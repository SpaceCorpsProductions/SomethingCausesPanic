Item #: SCP-4688 

Object Class: Artifact 

Containment Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: Instances of SCP-4688 are to be stored in a 
standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76. This container is to be 
reinforced with a Faraday cage to prevent possible interactions with 
internet-based devices. SCP-4688 may not be stored in the vicinity of 
electricity-based SCP objects, nor should it be allowed to come in contact with 
electrical wiring of any kind. 

Testing of SCP-4688's suggestion effect may proceed with permission from Project 
Head/46881. Testing must be carried out in an electronically isolated testing 
chamber with no electronic devices. As of the cessation of Incident 4688-Omega, 
Testing of SCP-4688's interactions with electronic devices is forbidden. 

Description: SCP-4688 are a series of Bell-brand children's bike helmets. 
Although the design of SCP-4688 instances vary, the word "ERIC2" is always 
written in a child's handwriting with white marker on each helmet's inside. 

Anomalous properties begin when SCP-4688 is worn by a sapient being capable of 
understanding language. The wearer of SCP-4688 will enter a trance state where 
several parts of the brain related to critical thought are either shut down or 
suppressed. Outwardly, subjects will experience slurred speech, impaired motor 
control, and susceptibility to suggestion. Subjects under the influence of 
SCP-4688 will not refuse any order given to them, except if it will obviously 
bring harm to the subject in question. 

This suggestion effect appears to be the primary purpose of SCP-4688, given the 
fact that "MIND CONTROL HELMET" is also written inside of some instances of 
SCP-4688 alongside the aforementioned "ERIC". Notably, subjects will still 
retain personality while wearing SCP-4688 and, if left alone, will go about 
their routine without interference. 

It is of note that some instances of SCP-4688 were recovered with rusted copper 
wiring attached to the frontal area and sides of the helmet. In accordance with 
the containment procedures developed in the wake of Incident 4688-Omega, this 
wiring has been removed.

[REPORT PENDING SUMMARIZATION] 

I'm not taking this one, no way, no how. I know I'm probably the most qualified 
person here, but I don't want to lose my stomach again. 

It's selfish of me, I know, but leave this one to one of the researchers, or 
something. I put all the relevant shit below. I'd love to go my whole life 
without needing to look at the internet again.

SCP-4688 Instances #29-32 Recovery Report

Authored By: Agent Laster

It turns out that the fellow who started the whole thing lived with
his mother.

She was a nice old lady, couldn't be younger than 65. Actually offered
me some chocolate chip cookies just for visiting (whatever deity made
me allergic to chocolate is going to get my foot up its ass). We had a
conversation. Apparently, her husband was an hedge fund manager, and
left her a good sum of money. Explained why she was able to afford a
flat in the middle of Cupertino.

Eventually, I guided the conversation over to why I came; the helmets,
and her son. He was around 40, never left home. He'd gotten a comp-sci
degree but never used it for anything much. Never could keep down a
job, either for his social awkwardness or his tendency to babble about
machines. Only ever came out of the basement for food and the
occasional WiFi fix. Other than that, he was, and I quote, "a sweet
boy".

I didn't have the heart to tell her he was a Maxwellist.

For those who haven't seen 'em yet, Maxwellism is like the Church of
the Broken God, but instead of thinking that their God is all in the
machines, they think it's all across the internet. For the most part,
they're the same. Same augmented cultists, same machine worship, same
shit all around. However, when your God's on the internet, you're
obviously gonna spend a lot of time there searching for 'em. As you
can probably tell, that attracts a certain demographic.

First, I asked her about bike helmets. She said she had some, but her
son took them all down to the basement for some LARP-related reason.
Then, I asked her to go to the basement, so I could meet him. She said
sure, but he doesn't like being disturbed. She led me to the back of
the house and opened up a cellar door; she gave it a good three-meter
berth. I smelt three things: old food, piss, and— the real kicker—
dead bodies. You can smell 'em from a mile away, once you've worked
with four-four-seven enough.

There were these shitty wooden steps leading down to the basement.
Every time I took a step down, it made a creaking noise. I swear to
God, the smell got worse every time I went down; I had to plug my nose
by the fifth step, and not just because of the dead body smell. By the
time I got to the door, the stench was so rancid, I was thinking about
leaving and coming back with one of the air recyclers the breach
specialists use to deal with toxic environments.

Then I opened the door, and I had to step back, I got hit with a
fucking wave of death. I think my brain kinda blocked out the memory
of the shebang, but from what I remember, there was a shit ton of food
on the floor. Rotting, decaying food, with legitimate rats crawling
all over them. There was shit on the floor; I'm not sure where it came
from. The walls were smeared with some kind of fleshy crap; if you
looked close enough, you could see the Star Wars posters underneath.
They had a pretty nice computer, I remember that well enough. It's
such a shame that three fucking cadavers were hooked up to it, and one
of 'em had a big hole in his stomach from the rats making a nest
there.

I'm no chicken, but I got out of there as fast as I could. I yanked
the helmets off of all of 'em, turned tail and ran back up the stairs.
Oh yeah, one more quick detail. The wires were burnt out, and they had
the same fleshy shit all over. I got some of it on my hand, and I
didn't notice 'til I got back to Site-34 and it set off a quarantine
alarm.

SCP-4688 - Revision 2017-09-30
 
SCP-4688

Item #: SCP-4688

Object Class: Artifact/Online

Containment Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Instances of SCP-4688 are to be stored
in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76, reinforced
with a Faraday cage.

When not undergoing testing, SCP-4688-1 are to be stored on separate
airgapped servers physically stored out of the range of any wireless
connection. A Foundation-maintained web scraper (I/O-AVIAN) is to scan
popular internet sites and forums for evidence of SCP-4688-1. They are
then to be lured into a controlled Foundation server and brought into
containment.

Description: SCP-4688 are a series of Bell-brand children's bike
helmets. The Foundation currently possesses 12 instances of SCP-4688;
however, it is confirmed that more exist outside of containment.

Anomalous phenomena begin when SCP-4688 is worn by a sapient being
capable of understanding language. The wearer of SCP-4688 will enter a
trance state where they experience slurred speech, impaired motor
control, and susceptibility to suggestion. Subjects under the
influence of SCP-4688 will not refuse any order given to them, except
if it will obviously bring harm to the subject in question.

However, through a poorly understood process involving the connection
of SCP-4688 to an internet-enabled computer, the wearer of SCP-4688
will instead become comatose. So far, no means known to the Foundation
have been successful at awakening affected subjects from this coma,
even after the removal of SCP-4688. Following this, an executable file
(hereafter SCP-4688-1) will appear on the computer and run itself.

SCP-4688-1 do not have a true interface; however, it is able to bypass
standard memory protections and access other software on the computer
in significant manners. In addition, SCP-4688-1 can transfer itself
across internet connections to access other computers. Interactions
with SCP-4688-1 instances have revealed them to be sapient, and they
will claim to be the subject who had previously become comatose from
wearing SCP-4688. Decompilation of SCP-4688-1 instances has yet to
yield any significant results.


Addendum 4688-1: Discovery

SCP-4688 was originally found in the possession of a con artist, who
had used it to steal several people's possessions under the cover of a
street magician. See Recovery Log 4688-SCHOOL for a collection of
recovery incidents pertaining to other SCP-4688 instances.

The existence of SCP-4688-1 was brought to the Foundation's attention
after an instance modified the Google home page to feature surrealist
artwork by Tinas van Doorn and a string of seemingly random text. This
was addressed by Google cybersecurity teams within 5 minutes of the
incident; however, images of the modified webpage began to circulate
popular internet forums. Information was disseminated indicating that
these images were hoaxes.

Although the string appears to be random, it is of note that the words
"LAN" and "IO" occur multiple times.

Foundation web crawlers were fine tuned, revealing the presence of
several more instances of SCP-4688-1 on popular servers that had
remained hidden prior to the incident. It is unknown when the first
instance of SCP-4688-1 was created, nor how many there are outside of
Foundation containment.


Chat Log Transcript 4688-JONSWORDS

Foreword: The following transcript was intercepted as a private
message conversation between users Jonswords and ERIC1234 in the ████
IRC server. It is of note that Jonswords is the primary alias for
PoI-8902 ("Jonathan Harris"), a high-ranking member of GoI-004C
("Church of Maxwellism") and one of the first instances of SCP-4688-1.

10:42 Jonswords: hey there kiddo

10:44 ERIC1234: Hi

11:08 Jonswords: YAYYYY!!!! i want everyone to be my friend :) thank you Eric

11:11 ERIC1234: Your welcome


SCP-4688 - Revision 2017-11-05

Item #: SCP-4688

Object Class: Artifact/Online

Containment Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Instances of SCP-4688-A are to be
stored in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76. This
container is to be reinforced with a Faraday cage to prevent further
interactions with internet-based devices.

Foundation medical journals are to fabricate a disease that causes
sudden and irreversible comas, in order to cover the activity of
SCP-4688-1. Security patches are to be distributed worldwide to
prevent further incursions into servers of importance. SCP-4688-1
activity outside of the aforementioned are to be covered up by several
Foundation-sponsored "hacktivist" groups.

Description: SCP-4688 refers to a collection of anomalies originally
used to produce SCP-4688-1 instances. SCP-4688-A are a collection of
bike helmets that, when worn, induce suggestion. SCP-4688-B is an
electronic construct that, when connected to SCP-4688-A and a
computer, will create instances of SCP-4688-1. SCP-4688-B is currently
not in the Foundation's possession.

SCP-4688-1 are sapient computer programs produced when a human is
connected to SCP-4688 and an internet-enabled computer. SCP-4688-1 are
able to interact with the operating system in several ways in order to
communicate, and claim to be the human used to generate SCP-4688-1. It
is of note humans connected to SCP-4688 will become permanently
comatose after the operation.

In addition, humans exposed to SCP-4688-1-generated content (such as
an infected webpage) also have a chance to become comatose and
generate an instance of SCP-4688-1 without using SCP-4688. Combined
with SCP-4688-1's ability to easily navigate internet connections,
this has led to a rapid growth of SCP-4688-1 worldwide to
approximately 4,000 total instances.

SCP-4688-1 were originally produced by GoI-004C ("Church of
Maxwellism") in an attempt to further explore the internet to find
pieces of their god. The multiplicative effect of SCP-4688-1 is
believed to be a side effect that was a result of the nature of
SCP-4688 and the decrepit conditions it was in at the time of
acquiring.


Addendum: SCP-4688-B and several other components associated with
SCP-4688 have been destroyed. It is believed that, as a consequence of
this, SCP-4688-1 instances have vanished. Incident is awaiting
declassification. Cleanup operations involving the retrieval of all
instances of SCP-4688-A and possibly SCP-4688-B are underway.
Reclassification will occur when it has been verified that SCP-4688-1
no longer exists.

Efforts to cover up the mass disappearance of those transformed into
SCP-4688-1 is under way, as it is believed that SCP-4688-1 are no
longer recoverable.
