NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY
ADMINISTRATION

The following documentation has experienced multiple iterations as
more information has been discovered.

TIMESTAMP: 18/09/2027

— Maria Jones, Director, RAISA



Item #: SCP-5296 

Object Class: Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5296 is secured in its testing chamber in 
Site-11. Its testing chamber is fitted with 4 Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs). 
SCP-5296 is to be monitored by at least 3 members of staff who perceive its 
existence. 

Description: SCP-5296 appears to be a semi-physical entity whose existence is 
permeable and subject to factors that are as of yet undetermined. The precise 
nature of SCP-5296 is unknown. Even amongst those who perceive it to exist, 
there is little agreement on any of SCP-5296's features, presenting it as a 
sizeable threat to consensus reality. 

These inconsistencies are largely universal, applying even to a single 
individual's continuous perception of SCP-5296. Common points of disagreement in 
decreasing order of controversy1 include: 

Whether or not SCP-5296 exists 

Whether or not SCP-5296 is humanoid 

Whether or not SCP-5296 can communicate 

Whether or not SCP-5296 is memetic or reality-warping 

Due to its ambiguous nature, SCP-5296 has caused much conflict within the 
Foundation over its properties. It is currently unknown if this is an intended 
effect or not. 

Discovery: SCP-5296 was seized by MTF-Phoenix-1 ("Mind Over Matter") on 
24/06/2027. It was discovered during a Foundation raid to recover 
SCP-████ from [REDACTED] after a containment breach. It was found in a 
hidden room which was marked on an assailant's map of the complex. On entering 
the room, MTF-Phoenix-1 found a note describing SCP-5296. The note was 
subsequently deemed irrecoverable after a skirmish with remaining assailants. 
MTF-Phoenix-1 did not recall the contents of the note in sufficient detail to 
assist in initial documentation. SCP-5296 and SCP-████ were retrieved 
and brought to Site-11 without further incident. 

Of note, members of MTF-Phoenix-1 claimed not to have noticed SCP-5296 until 
after having read the note about it. 


Addendum-5296-A 

Although SCP-5296 has, as of yet, proved easy to contain, it has caused 
significant disruption within the Foundation, detailed below: 

Date 

Events regarding SCP-5296 


26/06/2027 

On Junior Researcher Smith's assignment to SCP-5296, he made several complaints 
about it being “an empty room”. He also made several appeals to Site Command 
to delete the files regarding SCP-5296 and to cease "wasting our time on 
non-entities." Due to his misconduct, he was later referred to the disciplinary 
committee. 


04/07/2027 

Senior Researcher Aster experienced minimal difficulties in his preliminary 
research. However, video records of his initial tests were lost upon a routine 
scan of the Foundation database, wherein I.T staff deleted them, commenting 
“Assumed unnecessary equipment test: D-Class was standing in an empty room.” 


26/07/2027 

Research continued from here; however, it was slightly impeded by pressure to 
complete investigations quickly. As a result of this and a general effort by the 
Foundation to cut down on use of resources, all projects relating to SCP-5296 
were halted until an appeal by Aster was approved. 


02/08/2027 

A formal inquiry into SCP-5296 was launched, leading to the near-deletion of the 
SCP-5296 file by Site Command in a 9-1 vote on the matter. After further 
investigation, no consensus was reached on SCP-5296 and its file remained 
pending deletion. They settled that research should proceed as planned. 


10/08/2027 

In accordance with the disruption it had caused, SCP-5296 was raised as an issue 
to the O5-Council, who also experienced difficulties in coming to any agreement 
regarding SCP-5296. 

Following the O5-Council meeting on 10/08/2027, research into SCP-5296 is now 
considered a top priority. SCP-5296 has been provisionally classed as Keter. 


Addendum-5296-B 

Further review of our files regarding SCP-5296 suggests its nature may be vastly 
different to our initial assessments. SCP-5296 may very well be a figment of our 
imaginations. 

- Senior Researcher Aster 

Following review of the above proposal, further testing of SCP-5296 has been 
approved to determine the likelihood of this theory. 


Test Log 5296-01 

This test was overseen by Senior Researcher Aster on 09/09/2027. 

Testing Procedure: 

This test consisted of two executions with minor alterations: 

Standard Procedure: 

A D-Class will enter SCP-5296's testing chamber and follow the instructions of 
Senior Researcher Aster, who will be remotely observing the test. 

The first execution was standard, but the D-Class was given a briefing prior to 
the test and was given a file describing SCP-52962. 

The second execution was identical to the first, excluding the lack of a 
briefing. 

Results: 

D-1412, who had received the briefing, perceived SCP-5296 and was generally 
consistent with previous observations regarding SCP-5296 and the lack of 
consensus around its properties. 

D-1583, who went in blind, was unable to perceive SCP-5296, complaining that 
there was nothing in the room to begin with. 

Observations: 

It would appear that the proposed theory may be correct, although the data set 
is insufficient to draw any conclusions. Further testing involving on-site staff 
is pending approval. 


Test Log 5296-02 

This test was overseen by Senior Researcher Aster on 11/09/2027. 

Testing Procedure: 

This was effectively a large-scale version of the previous test. Site staff was 
divided into two groups, one that was briefed beforehand whilst the other was 
not. They then each attempted to perceive SCP-5296. 

Results: 

Everyone in the group that went in with no prior knowledge failed to perceive 
SCP-5296, whilst everyone in the other group was able to perceive SCP-5296. The 
results after testing over 200 on-site personnel were consistent with the 
proposed theory, however also raise another possibility. 

Observations: 

These results are conclusive. They leave only two possibilities: 

SCP-5296 is indeed a figment of the observer's imagination. 

SCP-5296 is somehow aware of our belief in it and its permeable existence 
responds in kind. 

SCP-5296 will hereafter be reclassified as Safe, since the discord it initially 
caused has run its course and its properties are now beginning to be understood. 


Addendum 5296-C 

As recent test results have raised concerns that SCP-5296 may be reliant on 
human belief in order to exist, it has been raised as an issue to the Ethics 
Committee. This is due to be discussed on 25/09/2027 during a meeting of the 
Ethics Committee. 



Footnotes 

1. This is not to say that the lower down items on the list are more agreed 
upon, merely that they are less often argued about. 

2. This file was the improvised template that was pending the results of these 
tests. 



Current Iteration 


Item #: SCP-5296

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Known SCP-5296 instances should be
reported to Site-11 Command. Currently, ██ instances are in
containment, each of which occupies a standard humanoid containment
chamber.

The locations of any suspected instances should be reported to
MTF-Phoenix-1.

Description: SCP-5296 is a race of sapient humanoids who are
imperceptible to humans. SCP-5296's undetectability is mitigated if an
individual is already aware of its existence.

SCP-5296 instances are only aggressive when provoked. They have
above-average combative abilities, largely due to their anomalous
effects. They can, however, be reliably subdued through the use of
special arms fire. Given the unknown number of SCP-5296 instances,
combating the threat they could pose should be left to MTF-Phoenix-1.


Incident Report 5296-01

On 14/09/2027, SCP-5296-23, the only instance in containment at the
time, breached containment through unknown means. This breach went
unnoticed by staff due to SCP-5296's anomalous effects until
SCP-5296-23 returned to the facility accompanied by approximately 50
other instances.

Upon returning, the instances became aggressive and caused a major
containment breach within the Euclid section of containment. The
initial response was worsened significantly by instances obstructing
re-containment efforts.

Over 100 members of staff were killed prior to MTF-Phoenix-1 securing
the site.

Proposals to upgrade SCP-5296 from Euclid to Keter are currently under
review.


Accessing Addendum-5296-A is restricted to Level 4 personnel and above

Credentials accepted. Welcome O5-1.

In accordance with our current containment procedures, the preceding
document was implemented in place of SCP-5296's file.

Senior Researcher Aster



Classified Iteration


WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS LEVEL 4/5296 CLASSIFIED

ANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 4/5296 AUTHORIZATION
WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

Item #: SCP-5296

Object Class: Dependent1

Special Containment Procedures: Per ruling of the Ethics Committee, a
veil is to be maintained regarding SCP-5296 so long as it instills
genuine belief of SCP-5296's existence. Personnel with lower security
clearance have been provided with a file detailing a false description
of SCP-5296 in an effort to reduce any further potential conflict.

In accordance with the ruling made by the Ethics Committee on
25/09/2027, the Foundation is to make no attempts to harm SCP-5296.

If any concerns are raised regarding the fake description of SCP-5296,
they are to be dismissed and, if repeatedly brought forward, to be
reported to Site Command who will decide how to proceed.

The only known instance of SCP-5296 (designated SCP-5296-α) is
currently in Foundation custody.

Description: SCP-5296 is a disembodied, semi-physical humanoid whose
existence appears to be tied to the genuine belief of said existence
by human observers. Belief in crude images or misrepresentations of
SCP-5296 is also sufficient for it to exist. Any genuine belief in its
existence is effectively "made true.”

It is currently unknown if SCP-5296-α is the only instance “in
existence”; however, there have been several unverified reports by
staff of the appearance of other instances.

Humans who perceive instances of SCP-5296 remain inconsistent in their
observations, however a larger degree of coherence has been achieved
in recent tests involving SCP-5296-α.


Addendum-5296-A

On 25/06/2027, the Ethics Committee held a meeting to decide how to
advise Site-11 staff regarding Senior Researcher Aster's findings
about the potential that SCP-5296 relies on humans to exist.

The following is an extract of the Ethics Committee's discussion (as
taken from the logs of the meeting) on SCP-5296, as well as the
statement that was sent to Site Command:


- Log-5296-01

NOTICE TO SITE COMMAND AND PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO SCP-5296

Per recent Ethics Committee ruling and subsequent testing of SCP-5296,
all personnel who are currently, or were in past, assigned to SCP-5296
are to report to B5-24 for a briefing regarding changes to
containment. Site Command is to read over and implement the changes
proposed in the attached document.

— ██████ Mathiesson, The Ethics Committee


Addendum-5296-B

So we still don't really know much about SCP-5296. In fact, we're
still unsure if it even exists, never mind this whole question of its
sapience.

But the Ethics Committee were quite clear in their judgement: while we
acknowledge the likelihood the SCP-5296 doesn't exist, we must treat
them with the respect and care we would expect in their position, just
in case they do.

And not doing so would be an unbelievable mistake.

Senior Researcher Aster
