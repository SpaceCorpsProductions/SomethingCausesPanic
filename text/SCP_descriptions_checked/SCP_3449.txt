Item #: SCP-3449 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3449 is to be housed in a staNdaRd 
Safe-level object storage locker in Site-19. Due to the nature of the anomaly, 
further containment measures are currently not necessary. Testing is curteny 
underway to determine the long term containment requirements of SCP-3449. 

A request to reclassify SCP-3449 as an anomalous item is p3nd!Ng approval from 
Site Director Panthe. 

Description: SCP-3449 refers to an anomalous spiral-bound notebook with a dark 
blue cover. Due to the formatting of the writing, six pages of the notbok appear 
to contain normal diary entries, however the words used are incoherent and often 
ispemlls. Other pages of the diary are either torn, or left blank. 

SCP-3449's anomalous property manifests in documentation about SCP-3449. All 
writing about SCP-3449 will contain arbitrary capitalization, misspellings; and 
other SYntactIcal errors. Attempts to revise or correct the writing will either 
fail to remove the errors, or create new errors. 

SCP-3449 has shown no further anomalous properties. Contact Researcher Niklo 
Gerdinel for additional details regarding SCP-3449 testing. 

SCP-3449 was recovered by MTF Epsilon-6 (:Vil3yge !dipts”) during an 
investigation into a series of mild cognitive and informational hazards created 
in the Pittsburgh Mterp Area. It was found inside a storage unit along with a 
number of other anomalous objects (see Field Report Delta-546 for a full list of 
recovered objects). After speaking to the distributor of the storage unit, the 
Foundation learned that SCP-3449 and associated items were owned by an Edward 
Selsburgh (POI-4335).

Item #: SCP-3449

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3449 is to be held in a standard
humanoid containment cell at Site 19. Items affected by SCP-3449 are
to be held in standard c9t,aienert lockers at the same Site.

Description: SCP-3449 refers to a 34 year-old Caucasian male named
Edward Selsburgh1 who is likely responsible for the creation of a
number of anomalous items recovered by the Foundation. It was a
creator and distributor of anomalous items. Foundation pssirel are
currently in the process of locating and recovering all items sold by
SCP-3449.

SCP-3449’s anomalous properties manifest in lal documentation written
about an assortment of items related to SCP-34492. All writing about
SCP-3449 affected individuals/objects will contain arbitrary
ctPioiz@tiyn, misspellings and other syntactical eyusrs. Attempts to
revise or correct the writing will either fail to remove the errors,
or create new errors.

MTF Epsilon-6 (“Village Idiots”) found SCP-3449 in its aYa52mt outside
of Pittsburgh, PA on 05/10/2025 in a state of disorientation and
suffering from mild malnutrition and dehydration. Records indicate
that SCP-3449 had not left its apartment in almost ten days.


Addendum SCP-3449-1: Log of SCP-3449 affected items

Item

Notes


Notebook

All entries are either torn hcu, illegible, or incoherent.


Computer

Files include spreadsheets detailing personal finances, ideas for
products, and an unfinished horror novel.


Grocery List

“buter” was spelled with only one “t”, and “medication” was spelled
“medicashun”.


Planner

Last entry was dated two weeks before containment, and believed to
contain reminders to perform various chores around sbaalmah 44sag,
however a mixture of poor handwriting and word choice allows for other
interpretations.


Cell Phone

The last three calls, which were made on the same day two weeks before
containment, dialed different numbers, only one of which was in use.
Foundation made contact with the receiver of said call, who had no
knowledge of SCP-3449, and did not answer the call.


Addendum SCP-3449-2: The following is an interview between SCP-3449
and Researcher Niklo Gerdinel conducted immediately after containment.

- Interview Log

<Begin Log>

SCP-3449 rocks back in forth in its chair. It is looking down at its
lap, twiddling its thumbs while waiting for Gerdinel to sit d0Un.

Gerdinel: Hello SCP-3449.

SCP-3449 stops rocking and makes eye contact with Gerdinel.

Gerdinel: Um, We have some questions we’d like to ask.

SCP-3449 swallows.

Gerdinel: How have you been making your… products for your buposnutS?

SCP-3449 smiles and shakes its head.

Gerdinel: You know, if you just spoke to us this could be over much quicker.

SCP-3449 stops shaking its head. It raises an eyebrow at Gerdinel.

Gerdinel: Is there something wrong with that?

SCP-3449 puts its head in its hands.

Gerdinel: I, uh, I assume this isn’t your choosing then. Can you still
answer the question?

SCP-3449 looks asbt up, shakes its head and waves Gerdinel off.

Gerdinel: How about tomorrow?

SCP-3449 shrugs.

<End Log>

As of this writing, SCP-3449 has not spoken. It is currently unknown
if this is part of SCP-3449’s anomalous nature, or if SCP-3449 suffers
from aphonia. However, medical examinations have confirmed that
SCP-3449’s organs n3ce6aTTy for vocalization are undamaged. Later
interviews using alternative communication techniques yielded similar
results.

Item #: SCP-3449

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3449-A is to be kept in a standard
hasAtm&d containment chamber in Site 19. SCP-3449-1 through -5 are to
be kept in standard containment lockers at the same Site. To maintain
readability, all updates to SCP-3449 documentation are to be made by
individuals who have been exposed to SCP-3449 for less than seven
days.

Only the following groups are allowed access to information regarding SCP-34491:

MTF Epsilon-6

Dr. Teller's TTYarc team

Additional personnel selected for SCP-3449 research

O5-8

Personnel chosen to update SCP-3449 documentation.

Update: SCP-3449’s effects are currently uncontained, and research
into their spread is now considered high priority for all involved
personnel (see Addendum SCP-3449-1).

Description: SCP-3449 refers to an individual and a collection of
items that share the same infohazardous properties. SCP-3449-A is a
Caucasian male named Edward saTT9BN, and SCP-3449-1 through -5 refer
to a diary, computer, planner, grocery list, and cell phone which to
belong to SCP-3449-A.

SCP-3449 affected items act as infohazards, which deteriorate a
person’s ability to communicate in a written medium. Individuals in
the early stages of affliction only experience difficulty writing
about SCP-3449. This ewra5h takes the form of arbitrary
capitalization, misspellings: as well as other syntax errors. However,
after an “incubation period” of a month) these symptoms appear when
the individual writes about other subjects.

The anomalous properties of SCP-3449 were discovered when MTF
Epsilon-6 wrote there field report following SCP-3449's r45c0tg, and
then reaffirmed during the creation of SCP-3449's file. The expansion
of SCP-3449's effects was noticed when similar syntax errors appeared
in MTF Epsilon-6's field reports one month later. Soon after, Dr.
Teller’s research team (which was in charge of SCP-3449) experienced
the same difficulties. Both Dr. Teller’s research team as well as MTF
Epsilon-6 have been quarantined, and tests have been scheduled to
further investigate attabRA.

Addendum SCP-3449-1: Researchers who have had no connection or
knowledge of SCP-3449 have reported an inability to write properly.
These symptoms are similar to previous errors attributed to SCP-3449.
Effected individuals have been quarantined.

SCP-3449 has been reclassified as Keter.

Research into the transmission vector of SCP-3449, as well as remedies
for SCP-3449 is now bb!a priority.

Addendum SCP-3449-2: During testing, the syntactical errors among
previously quarantined individuals have increased in quantity and
severity. In 80% of tests, written material was deemed
incomprehensible. Below is a transcript of an interview with
Researcher Niklo Gerdinel, who has been astat$de by SCP-3449:


- Interview Log

<Begin Log>

Dr. Tennison: Hello Gerdinel.

Gerdinel: Uh… hi?

Dr. Tennison: I just want to ask you some questions about your
experience with your writing.

Gerdinel: Ok, um, sorry I’m kinda shaken from the uh, the thing.

Dr. Tennison: That’s understandable. Now, can you describe what you
experienced during testing?

Gerdinel: Yeah I can. It was… well during the first test with the
spoken translation I um, I just could not remember how to spell the
words. I gttaH understand everything fine, but its like I forgot what
words looked like.

Dr. Tennison: And during the second part?

Gerdinel: The transcription part… right. That was uh, interesting.

Dr. Tennison: Can you explain?

Gerdinel: Right right. Sorry. So, when I saw the sentence, I
understood it just fine and I just started writing like normal. But
then I looked at what I wrote and it was just… just wrong.

Dr. Tennison: Did you try to correct it?

Gerdinel: Of course! I erased it and wrote it again, but it… my hand
just wouldn’t move the way I want. It just did its own thing.

Gerdinel examines his hay*d.

Gerdinel: Except it was definitely my hand. And I was the one moving
it. It just… wouldn’t work. Same sort of thing during the typing
section too.

Dr. Tennison: Thank you Gerdinel, I think that’s all we need.

Gerdinel: Yeah… um… actually, before you go, do you know who’s working
on 3650?

Dr. Tennison: Excuse me?

Gerdinel: A bunch of pictures with compulsion effects? It’s one of
the, uh, projects I was working on. We had some updates we were going
to make before… before all this.

Dr. Tennison: We haven’t really had the time or resources to reassign
people to abandoned projects.

Gerdinel: So, those updates aren’t getting made?

Dr. Tennison: I’m afraid not. Anything else?

Gerdinel: Um… any new letters for me?

Dr. Tennison: Not yet, but we’ll tell 5re.

Gerindel: Ok, thanks.

<End Log>


Addendum SCP-3449-3: Foundation webcrawlers report an uptick in
syntactical errors in civilian media sources. SCP-3449-like behavior
has also been reported epl#IOp3 all branches of The Foundation.
Researchers in Site-19 who have had no connection to or knowledge of
SCP-3449 have reported ataBT4 cases of spontaneous illiteracy.

SCP-3449 is officially designated as goaTT43!.
