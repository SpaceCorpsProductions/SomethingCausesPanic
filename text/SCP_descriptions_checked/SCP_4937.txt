Item #: SCP-4937 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4937 is to be kept in Storage Containment 
Unit █-██ inside a 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm padded container. Personnel 
should be cautious when handling the object due to its fragile nature. 

Description: SCP-4937 appears to be a partially deflated 260Q modelling balloon 
of ordinary make and white coloration, originally measuring 32 cm from the end 
to the inflation valve, in a form described as that of a dog. 

SCP-4937 is the subject of a cognitohazardous meme. Information regarding its 
properties, behavior, and nature is "evasively excessive". Thus, it is only 
possible to understand information regarding SCP-4937 through direct 
observation. 

Attempts to describe SCP-4937's abstract properties have failed, as a result of 
either excessive imposition or evasive exposition. As such, information 
regarding SCP-4937 may or may not be true, and it may or may not present a 
significant threat to containment security. 

In an ordinary sense, memes are essentially living ideas, and the proposed 
anti-meme is a suicidal meme. But this one, it's different. It grows, yes, but 
in the wrong direction. It isn't spreading or concealing information about 
itself, but rather, it's spreading the wrong information. It just wants us to 
think it's a balloon dog. And since we can't understand it, and don't know what 
the hell it is, it’s probably no laughing matter. - Dr. Marcus Sonoma 


Addendum 4937-1: 

SCP-4937 was recovered on █/██/████ at Site-██ by Junior 
Researcher Nolan Rogers. No prior records of SCP-4937 exist, and Rogers is 
unable to recall information regarding SCP-4937 before █/██/████. 
Rogers claims to be unable to speak about SCP-4937. The following is a 
transcript of an interview with Rogers. 

Date: █/██/████ 

Interviewer: Dr. Marcus Sonoma 

Interviewee: Nolan Rogers 

<Begin Log> 

Dr. Sonoma: Please identify yourself. 

Rogers: Nolan Rogers. No d in Rogers. 

Dr. Sonoma: I assume you understand why you're here. 

Rogers: I suppose this has to do with SCP-4937. 

Dr. Sonoma: Yes. Let's start from the beginning. How did you come to know of 
SCP-4937? 

Rogers: I don't know. How do you? 

Dr. Sonoma: Well, through you, of course. 

Rogers remains silent for a few moments. 

Rogers: Then that's my answer. 

Dr. Sonoma: But how were you made aware of SCP-4937 before RAISA, if you knew it 
was SCP-4937? 

Rogers: How should I know? You guys called it 4937, not me. 

Dr. Sonoma: No, in the first draft you sent to Morowitz- 

Rogers: Look, I might recall more information tomorrow. It's really- 

Dr. Sonoma: Right, almost forgot. What is it with the wordplay? 

Rogers: What? 

Dr. Sonoma: Tomorrow, it's. Morowitz. And then in your emails, it's all puns. 

Rogers: I didn't…oh. Oh! That's it! 

Dr. Sonoma: What's it? 

Rogers: It's SCP-4937! 

Rogers begins laughing uncontrollably. 

Dr. Sonoma: What about it? 

Rogers: Everything! The unusual circumstances, that it's a popped balloon dog, 
everything! It's a joke, we're the punch line, and it's not even funny! 

Dr. Sonoma: What? 

Rogers: It's just a balloon dog. We blew things out of proportion.
