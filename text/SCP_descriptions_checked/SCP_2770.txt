Item #: SCP-2770 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: All ships must be prevented from approaching 
SCP- 2770. Instances of SCP-2770 are to be tracked by Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 
("Deep Feeders") via Foundation orbital assets and intercepted by Gamma-6 
vessels. Anyone seen attempting interaction with SCP-2770-1 is to be detained 
before contact is made and administered Class-B amnestics. 

Description: SCP-2770 is the designation of two seaborne anomalies. 

SCP-2770-1 is a bright yellow life raft, carrying a human male that identifies 
itself as a member of the British Royal Navy. Its uniform, showing notable signs 
of degradation, is consistent with the standard British naval dress code circa 
19██. It will manifest in the North Sea, defined as the area between Great 
Britain and Scandinavia. SCP-2770-1 has been recorded never going beyond the 
boundaries of the Shetland Isles, or farther south than the area of Norfolk, 
with the exception of ████████████. Its appearance on 
the water is instant, marked only by a sudden burst of radio white noise on most 
electronic equipment. 

The life raft is too small to be reliably located by orbital imaging satellites, 
but its general location can be calculated by satellites equipped with thermal 
imaging, as water temperature drops by 3ºC in a 5km radius around SCP-2770-1. 

Once manifested, SCP-2770-1 will wait until it obtains visual of an occupied 
vessel. It will try to gain the vessel's notice with several methods, including 
shouting, waving its arms, and using its uniform as a makeshift flag. 

If it does not obtain the vessel's attention or is approached by a ship that 
does not intend rescue, it will be rapidly pulled underwater and not resurface 
for another 124 hours. However, if rescued, it will initiate a Boarding Event, 
and prompt the appearance of SCP-2770-2. 

SCP-2770-2 is a submarine, measuring 42m in length. It shows signs of extreme 
disrepair, with a thick layer of rust and barnacles coating most of the hull. 20 
to 60 seconds after SCP-2770-1 has been rescued, SCP-2770-2 will surface nearby 
SCP-2770-1's rescuing vessel at a speed far beyond the capability of any known 
submersible. After it has surfaced, the hatch on the submarine's conning tower 
will open. SCP-2770-1, 2770-2 and the rescuing vessel will all be pulled into 
the water by an unknown force at over 200 km/h, and disappear. There seems to 
be no upper limit to the size of the vessel that can be pulled underwater; 2770 
is known to have taken ships with displacements in excess of 50,000 long tons. 

After a Boarding Event, SCP-2770-1 will not appear for a minimum of 242 hours, 
with the length of its absence appearing to be linked to the size of the vessel 
taken. 

SCP-2770 was first theorized to exist in 19██ after a string of unexplained 
ship vanishings, and its existence confirmed in 1941, when the Gamma-6 vessel 
Panama-7 observed it interact with a fishing trawler. 

However, it is believed that SCP-2770 has been active since at least 1███, 
due to a report published by a British newspaper from the same year.

Excerpt from the Glasgow Weekly Report, March 12, 1███ 

WHALE SMASHES SHIP! 

A great tragedy on the seas. Local fishermen claim that a whaling ship off the 
coast rescued a castaway, only to be immediately attacked by a mammoth marine 
creature fitting the description of an abnormally large whale. The whale likely 
punctured the ship's hull during the attack, as it is claimed that the ship sunk 
incredibly quickly with no known survivors. 

The fishermen present also claim the event accompanied a sudden drop in the 
already-frigid North Sea's waters, describing it as "arctic". 

After containment implementation, Gamma-6 has prevented over ███ possible 
Boarding Events, with the average length between failures to intercept 
SCP-2770-1 currently at a tolerable level. A log of ships known to have 
experienced Boarding Events will now follow:

Incident 2770-C

With approval from O5-█, Operation Kiddie Pool was authorized on
██/██/████ with the express purpose of containing SCP-2770
indefinitely. This operation was designed by Dr. ████ and Agent
████████, as they theorized that from observations made of SCP-2770-1,
divorcing it from any notable source of water would both render
SCP-2770-2 incapable of manifesting, and remove SCP-2770-1's ability
to retreat back into the water.

The operation was divided into three parts:

Gamma-6 would locate and then lift SCP-2770-1 from the water via a
modified Mi-26 (operating name: "Lifeguard") equipped with a hooking
device created specifically for the operation.

With SCP-2770-1 hooked, Lifeguard would then transport SCP-2770-1 to
Site ██, a secure location in the hyper-arid ████████ Desert.

Once arrived, Gamma-6 personnel would take custody of SCP-2770-1, well
isolated from any possible source of water.

On █/█/████, Operation Kiddie Pool commenced at ████ hours. At the
time of the operation, SCP-2770-1 was being tracked off the coast of
southern Norway, and was intercepted by Lifeguard thirty minutes,
twelve seconds after the commencement of the operation. SCP-2770-1 was
attached to the hook without any difficulties and lifted out of the
water with no appearance by SCP-2770-2.

Six hours, seventeen minutes later, Lifeguard arrived at Site ██,
delivering SCP-2770-1 into its custody. SCP-2770-1 surrendered itself
with no struggle, and SCP-2770-2 failed to manifest. Operation Kiddie
Pool was deemed a success.

An interrogation was conducted one week later. SCP-2770-1 had not
escaped custody with its previously recorded anomalous abilities, and
had been generally cooperative with staff at Site ██. Transcript of
video will now follow:

[SCP-2770-1 is escorted into the room by two Gamma-6 personnel and
sits down to a chair across from Agent ████████]

Agent ████████: Hello, SCP-2770-1.

SCP-2770-1: Hello, sir. Once again, I cannot tell you how grateful I
am for the rescue with your crazy hoverin' plane. I've been stranded
out there for…I don't know how long.

Agent ████████: We're always glad to help. So, SCP-2770-1, do you have
a name?

SCP-2770-1: I do, sir. Lieutenant Edward Rowling, Royal Navy, at your
service.

Agent ████████:  I see. What year do you think this is? Your uniform
is quite out of date.

SCP-2770-1: [rubs neck] I…do not know. Truth be told, the months and
years just started to meld together after a while. And apologies about
my uniform, I'll admit it's seen better days.

Agent ████████: About your days melding together. What can you tell me
about SCP-2770-2?

SCP-2770-1: Come again?

Agent ████████: The submarine. We have records of you being rescued by
ships, only for them to be attacked by a broken-down sub that
shouldn't even be able to move.

SCP-2770-1: Oh. That thing.

[SCP-2770-1 leans in]

SCP-2770-1: Well.

SCP-2770-1: I think…

Agent ████████: You think what?

SCP-2770-1: I think you forgot about the water table, you fucking
idiot.

[What appears to be the conning tower of SCP-2770-2 erupts in the
middle of the interrogation room. The hatch immediately opens,
followed by a total loss of communication with Site ██.]

END TRANSCRIPT

MTF dispatched to Site ██ finds the facility missing. Orbital assets
confirm that at the time of communication loss, Site ██ was pulled in
its entirety under the sand. Recovery teams present detect no traces
of the facility with subterranean imaging, and all staff are presumed
KIA.

After this event, SCP-2770-1 did not appear for another █ years.

Foundation secure site protocols now in full review.

SCP-2770 reclassification to Keter pending.

END INCIDENT REPORT
