Item #: SCP-4182 

Object Class: Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SILVER) is to 
review IntSCPFN servers for files affected by SCP-4182. These files are to be 
isolated and reported to the on-duty server administrator for review and 
sterilization. Personnel are to be reminded that there is no Site-5. 

Description: SCP-4182 is a phenomenon by which internal Foundation documents are 
periodically altered to include references to a non-existent site ("Site-5"). 
The mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be understood. 

Depictions of Site-5 are inconsistent, but typically describe it as a man-made 
island constructed to store hazardous materials.1 

Since its discovery in 2018, SCP-4182's rate of occurrence has been increasing 
exponentially.

Item #: SCP-4182

Object Class: Euclid


Special Containment Procedures: Personnel are to work with the JMSDF1
and other naval and aeronautic authorities to enforce a ten kilometer
exclusion zone around SCP-4182. Access is strictly prohibited.

A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SILVER) is to review IntSCPFN servers
for files affected by SCP-4182. These files are to be isolated and
reported to the on-duty server administrator for review and
sterilization. Personnel are to be reminded that there is no Site-5.

Description: SCP-4182 is a 6.4-hectare (16-acre) artificial island
located 75 kilometers south of Ipponsugi, Japan. Although no record of
its construction exists, its configuration suggests it was built as a
waste containment facility at some point in the early 20th century.

Foundation documents will periodically identify SCP-4182 as a
non-existent site ("Site-5"). The mechanism by which this occurs has
yet to be understood.

All of SCP-4182's structures were found sealed with reinforced acrylic
plating. No further attempt to remove these plates or examine the
interior of SCP-4182's structures is to be made.

Since its discovery in 2014, SCP-4182's rate of occurrence has been
increasing dramatically.

Item #: SCP-4182

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Personnel are to work with the JMSDF1
and other naval and aeronautic authorities to enforce a twenty-five
kilometer exclusion zone around SCP-4182. All entrances and windows
that provide access to SCP-4182's interior have been welded shut via
steel-reinforced acrylic paneling coated in a graded-Z laminate.
Access is strictly prohibited.

for files affected by SCP-4182. These files are to be isolated and

Foundation documents will periodically identify SCP-4182 as a
non-existent site ("Site-5"). The mechanism by which this occurs has
yet to be understood.

Several of SCP-4182's (now sealed) structures contained stairwells
plugged with concrete. Excavations of these stairwells led to the
discovery of a massive subterranean complex located beneath SCP-4182
containing a ████ ██ █████ ███████. No further excavations are to be
made.

Since its discovery in 2001, SCP-4182's rate of occurrence has been
increasing significantly.

Item #: SCP-4182

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Personnel are to work with the JMSDF1
and other naval and aeronautic authorities to enforce a fifty
kilometer exclusion zone around SCP-4182. All stairwells leading to
SCP-4182's sub-complex are to be sealed with (approx.) two meters of
concrete composite (a formulation of cement, water, and heavy weight
aggregates that provide additional radiation shielding) reinforced
with steel. Access is strictly prohibited.

A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SILVER) is to review IntSCPFN servers
for alterations made by personnel affected by SCP-4182. These
personnel are to be isolated and reported to on-duty Foundation agents
for review and sterilization. Personnel are to be reminded that there
is no Site-5.

Description: SCP-4182 is a 6.4-hectare (16-acre) artificial island
located ██ kilometers █████ of ██████████ █████. Although no record of
its construction exists, its configuration suggests it was built as a
waste containment facility at some point in the early 20th century.

Foundation personnel will periodically identify SCP-4182 as a
non-existent site ("Site-5"). The mechanism by which this occurs has
yet to be understood.

Personnel affected by SCP-4182 will descend one of several stairwells
throughout the facility, proceeding into a massive subterranean
complex that contains █ ████ ██ ███████████ █████████ █████ ███████.
Despite extensive seismological and radiometric surveys, the depth of
this sub-complex has yet to be determined (but is in excess of several
kilometers).

In 1989, a medical examination of several hundred bodies recovered
from SCP-4182 was conducted. In approximately 75% of cases, the
internal morphology showed minor to severe deviations from
topographical norms (typically concentrated in the central nervous
system). The most common cause of death was intracerebral hemorrhaging
brought on by the rapid onset of liquefactive necrosis inside the
brain. No further examinations are to be made.

Since its discovery in 1986, SCP-4182's rate of occurrence has been
increasing.
