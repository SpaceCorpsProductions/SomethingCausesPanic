Item #: SCP-4260 

Object Class: Euclid 

RAISA Notice Regarding the Following Document: 

This document has been significantly edited in order to obfuscate the identity 
of SCP-4260; several addenda have been omitted, and are only available with 
Level 5/4260 Clearance. 

Strayer Density Matrix Mark I, Research Site-76 

Special Containment Procedures: Area-03, located two kilometers beneath Hong 
Kong, has been created in order to contain SCP-4260. The containment chamber 
housing SCP-4260 has been augmented with a Strayer Density Matrix designed to 
coalesce and bind its disparate elements. 

Maintenance of the Strayer Density Matrix is integral to SCP-4260's containment 
and requires a specialized team of technicians and speculative essophysicists1. 
MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites") has been assembled for this expressed purpose and 
will perform any necessary repairs to the Matrix and operate it during the 
activation of Procedure 89172. 

Procedure 8917 requires a joint operation between three mobile task forces, 
assembled to ensure its effective completion. The assigned task forces, denoted 
collectively as Amalgamate Force Omicron-45, and their functions are as follows: 

MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites"): Assembled from numerous technicians proficient in 
the operation of Stayer Density Matrices and speculative essophysicists from RTF 
Iota-39 ("Gods and Monsters") who will assist in their direction. 

MTF Xi-2 ("Out of the Shadows Come We, Darkly"): An armed Mobile Task Force 
specializing in combat with essophysical, deity-class entities. MTF Xi-2 will 
engage SCP-4260 and terminate it, ending the initial stage of Procedure 8917. 

MTF Tau-900 ("Deliverance"): An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in the 
location of civilians accidentally affected by a successful neutralization of 
SCP-4260. MTF Tau-900 will then terminate all targets and remove evidence of the 
procedure's efficacy. 

Procedure 8917 is considered complete when the following criteria are met. 

SCP-4260 has been successfully terminated. 

The Strayer Density Matrix is fully operational. 

All affected civilians have been located and terminated. 

All evidence of Procedure 8917 has been removed. 

SCP-4260 has been resurrected. 

The document detailing SCP-4260 uploaded to the Foundation intranet is to 
contain numerous omissions, in order to obfuscate the identity of SCP-4260. 

Description: SCP-4260 refers to the consciousness of an essophysical entity 
which has permeated itself through the known universe. The effect of SCP-4260's 
existence has been well documented by almost every sapient culture. Termination 
of SCP-4260 has resulted in the neutralization of its primary anomalous effect 
until its resurrection during Procedure 8917.

ITEM#: 4260

LEVEL 5

CONTAINMENT CLASS: EUCLID

DISRUPTION CLASS: DARK

RISK CLASS: CRITICAL

Special Containment Procedures: The Containment Procedures of
Iteration α.4260 have been deemed unsuitable for the prolonged
containment of SCP-4260. As such, Experimental Operation “Many-Crowned
Serpent” was executed on 02/13/2016, in order to achieve optimal
containment. As a result, the nature of SCP-4260 has been radically
altered; errors persist throughout the following description.1

Description: SCP-4260 is the collective consciousness of an
essophysical entity which has permeated itself through the known
universe. SCP-4260's existence has resulted in the biological
senescence of sentient organisms and is the direct cause of any
organism's cessation of life functions.

SCP-4260 itself is subject to its own entropy, and its anomalous
influence on the universe has notably diminished in the preceding
millennia. It is projected that SCP-4260 will expire by achieving an
essophysical null-state in 2017 CE. The former containment procedures
of SCP-4260 proved both incapable of halting this effect and its
primary anomalous trait, although complete physical containment was
achieved.

Procedure 8917 was finalized in March of 1999, and involved the
termination of SCP-4260 — which would result in an ΩK-Class
("End-of-Death") Scenario — and its immediate reanimation via
anomalous means; the procedure was designed to prevent the deaths of
high-profile individuals within the Foundation and global extinction,
if either event arose.


Addendum.4260.β.1: Acquisition

Assest-4260: Timeline of Manifestation Event

Date: 01/13/1999

Context: Research Site-76 began to register anomalous seismic
activity, originating approximately one kilometer from the compound.
Anomalous spatial distortions indicated Site-76 was experiencing an
essophysical manifestation event; RTF Iota-39 deployed for retrieval
of object.

Involved Task Forces:

RTF Iota-39 ("Gods and Monsters")

MTF Mu-8 ("Southern Hospitality")

<12:09a>  Site-76 registers anomalous seismic activity.

<12:15a>  Readings recalibrated; cause of seismic activity determined
to be entropic in nature.

<01:03a>  RTF Iota-39 deployed.

<01:45a>  Iota-39 determines focal point of seismic activity;
essophysical and entropic activity confirmed. Temporary observational
post established.

<01:55a>  Spatial distortions around the origin point indicate a
manifestation event; Iota-39 experiences mild pulling force towards
the origin as SCP-4260 attempts to create an area dense enough to
manifest.

<02:08a>  ]A rough approximation of a human arm manifests at the
origin point; arm falls to ground and demanifests.

]<02:15a>  Iota-39 report massive pulling force from origin point,
observation post secured.

<02:31a>  Origin point is now sufficiently dense to facilitate a
manifestation, projected T-minus 36 minutes. Iota-39 requests
containment transport, Site-76 assembles and deploys MTF Mu-8.

<03:00a>  Manifestation event enters final stage, observational post
suffers minor damage as the origin point contracts. Mu-8 arrives and
prepares containment and transport.

<03:07a>  Manifestation event ends; SCP-4260 manifests at the origin
point as an elderly human. SCP-4260 appears severely disoriented and
requests immediate containment and hospitalization. Mu-8 restrains it
and begins transport to Site-76's medical bay.


Addendum.4260.β.2: Lecture Log


Date: 01/07/2000

Lecturer: RTF Iota-39 Lead Preston Bracks

Context: In response to the evident importance of Procedure 8917 to
the Foundation's continued operation, the Overseer Council assembled
an advisory panel composed of leading members of the Foundation's
Essophysics Department, among them RTF Lead Preston Bracks.

Individuals Present:

O5-4 through O5-13

Directors of Area-03 and Site-76

Nine (9) members of RTF Iota-39

Three (3) members of MTF Gamma-8

Ahem, alright, time to begin.


I am Dr. Preston Bracks, lead of RTF Iota-39 and Assistant Director of
our little Essophysics Department. I call it "little" because we only
have about twenty members — it actually came as a bit of a shock to us
when we received your, erm, invitation. Thought you'd forgotten about
us.

Regardless, The Essophysics Department is dedicated to the study of
entities which embody certain universal concepts, such as Time,
Science, and in the case of SCP-4260, Death. Old cultures referred to
them as gods, which is a bit of a misnomer; we call them Intrinsics.
Gods are reality-bending entities, usually with their own agendas and
identities. Intrinsics are concepts which cannot be separated from our
cosmos without us living in a radically different world. They’re more
concept than entity, and rarely take any sort of physical form.
SCP-4260 is somewhat of an anomaly in that regard.

As it stands, modern parascience is woefully ignorant of the basics of
essophysical reality. We have no idea how many Intrinsics exist, if
they can be contacted, and what degree of agency each one has. The
avenue towards containment, then, is research. I'm sure most of you
have been briefed about SCP-4260's retrieval last year, so I won't
belabor any points, but SCP-4260’s behaviors have proven to be beyond
insightful.

First, we know that these things aren’t omniscient or all-knowing,
because it came to us with hopes that we would know how to save it. It
was wrong.

Second, we know it’s smart. It chose the form of an elderly human,
superficially unthreatening and incapable of violence — this was a
calculated decision, meant to incline Mu-8 and Iota-39 towards helping
it instead of combatting it. It succeeded.

SCP-4260 does not have a defined personality, nor does it have any
goals or motivations beyond self-preservation. When the universe was
new, its strength was incalculable. Life could not even hope to begin.
Death was everywhere in the dark, dark expanse of a lonely cosmos. But
over time, a miracle occurred, maybe the first anomaly: Death began to
die. Slowly, ever so slowly, it began to be poisoned by its own
ever-present miasma. The million claws which reached from the dark and
tore down civilization took hold of their master as well, dragging it
screaming into the abyss.

Death is dying under our roof, Councilmembers. And that is the most
terrifying, and most fantastic news humanity may ever receive.


Greetings, O5-9.

Operation "Many-Crowned Serpent" has significantly altered the nature
of SCP-4260. An update to this file is currently pending approval by
the Foundation Archival Department to rectify the persistent errors
throughout Iteration β.4260.

Item #: SCP-4260

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4260 is to be quarantined in
secure facility Area-03, which has been converted into a secure
facility location, designed to protect SCP-4260 from most documented
K-Class "End-of-the-World" scenarios. The facility has been staffed
minimally, and no individual is to enter the central underground
chamber housing SCP-4260 at any time.

The central chamber in which SCP-4260 is contained is classified as a
large-scale entity containment unit and has been augmented with a
concurrent circuit of seven Strayer Density Matrices, maintained by
MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites"). If SCP-4260 attempts to exit its
containment chamber or contact any of the facility staff, O5-3, O5-4,
and O5-102 are to be alerted as soon as is possible.

Description: SCP-4260 is Foundation Administrator Ethan Horowitz, who
has undergone considerable physical augmentation as a result of
Operation "Many-Crowned Serpent".

SCP-4260's anomalous properties include, but are not limited to:

Extreme anatomical augmentations.

Anatomical manipulation.

Resistance to injury and incapacitation.

Essophysical abilities which remain poorly understood.

The essophysical entity previously cataloged as SCP-4260, prior to its
neutralization in Operation "Many-Crowned Serpent", exhibited several
of these anomalous traits to a more limited degree. After its
termination, Foundation Administrator Ethan Horowitz elected to
transfer its anomalous properties onto his own person, in accordance
with the contractual and ritualistic nature of Operation "Many-Crowned
Serpent".


Addendum.4260.1:

These are the Prime Directives of the Foundation: to secure, to
contain, and to protect; to remove anomalous items, persons, and
phenomena from the public sphere, to effectively suppress the
resurgence of these anomalies or the discovery of them by the general
public, and to hold above all else but reality itself the sanctity of
life and the necessity to preserve it.

This is the Subdirective of the Foundation: to terminate the primary
anomalous phenomenon which has plagued life since life’s conception,
or to facilitate the termination thereof.

This is the prime anomaly: Death.

The Subdirective was never meant to be feasible, at least not in the
day and age of our founding. We cannot hope to mitigate the disasters
that this would result in: overpopulation, species stagnation, and
susceptibility to cataclysmic extra-dimensional forces which can only
be contained via euthanization of those affected. It remained the
lonely dream of the men who began our venture to order chaos so many
decades ago.

Now, over a century later, we could achieve the subdirective at any
moment with only a missive sent to the lead of AF Omicron-45. I
suppose it would be marvelous to see: a world without death and
infirmity, each person freed from the dread of uncertainty and peril.
Maybe, one day, we will find a way to make that world.

Until such a time, we must secure the perpetual containment of death.
This is the nature of Many-Crowned Serpent: to fulfill the first steps
of the Foundation’s subdirective.

As it stands now, Death is a hostile entity intent on its own
self-preservation at any cost. We spoke, once, and I began to realize
that if it could feel anything at all, it would feel the same fear we
must face under its tyranny. We could not save Death from itself; as
far as our science has elevated us, our understanding of reality's
based components is sourly lacking. I told this to SCP-4260, and it
smiled. "Administrator," it said, "How can I die when I will live on
through you?"

Death has struck a deal with us. In all its arcane knowledge, it knows
a way to live on afterwards: it has chosen me to be its heir. It is a
choice between the eternal agony of humanity and a pain suffered only
until we know enough to repair our tired species. It is not a choice
at all.

This last evil I must allow us all to suffer patiently. Be bold, for
one day soon, we will have won the battle waged by both us and our
ancestors emerging from the primordial soup: the struggle for Life
Everlasting.

- Foundation Administrator Ethan Horowitz
