                               ------------------                               

Item #: SCP-1301 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 are to be kept inside 
a secured, soundproofed box inside of a secured, soundproofed chamber. Absolute 
silence is to be maintained at all times within the holding chamber, and 
personnel will not be permitted entry into the chamber without the provided 
noise containment suits. Prior authorization is required to handle either SCP. 

Any personnel or individuals that are contaminated by SCP-1301-1 in its active 
state are to be immediately contained for study, owing to SCP-1301-1's effects. 

Description: SCP-1301-1 is a violin of crimson hue, lacking a maker's label or 
other obvious sign of identification. Upon analysis, it has been found that its 
strings are made of spider silk, and that its body is composed of a variety of 
different woods, primarily spruce and maple. 

SCP-1301-2 is a violin bow, constructed from pernambuco wood of a crimson hue 
identical to SCP-1301-1. Its ribbon is comprised of black, coarse horsehair, but 
in all other regards it appears to be of usual construction. 

SCP-1301-1 is extremely sensitive to certain kinds of vibrations; if jostled 
violently or exposed to human voices, it will enter its active state and its 
strings will sound audibly for 1 to 13 minutes unless otherwise muffled. Direct 
exposure to the sound produced during the object's active state will invariably 
result in contamination. 

Over the 13 hours following initial exposure, individuals contaminated by 
SCP-1301-1 will permanently lose their voices, and be rendered incapable of 
speech, singing, or whispering. An additional effect of contamination is the 
loss of written language. While contaminated individuals appear to readily 
understand written and spoken words, their own attempts to write will instead 
result in musical notation of varying sophistication. Providing contaminated 
individuals with computers or other writing aids has only resulted in 
incomprehensible gibberish. 

While held, SCP-1301-2 protects the individual holding it from SCP-1301-1's 
active state, though it does not reverse this state's effects. If SCP-1301-2 is 
used to produce vibrations from one or more of SCP-1301-1's strings, a voice 
singing the appropriate pitch will emerge instead. The E and A strings produce a 
timbre resembling female voices, and the D and G strings produce a timbre that 
mirrors male voices, though exceptions have been noted to occur outside of the 
object's anomalous state. 

While being operated with SCP-1301-2, SCP-1301-1 may enter its anomalous state 
and produce any one of a number of atypical effects, which have thus far 
included weeping, crying, screaming, laughing, and unintelligible whispering. 
The object's anomalous state never exceeds 13 seconds in length.

Experiment Log 1301

Approved by O5-██

Selected tests below

Test 1

Date: ██/██/20██

Operator: ██████ ███████

Procedure: After donning the provided noise containment suit, Mr.
███████ entered the chamber, removed SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 from
their soundproof box, and began operation.

Music: Simple improvisation in A major, 4/4 meter.

Results: 1 minute and 3 seconds into operation, SCP-1301-1 entered its
first observed anomalous state and produced high-pitched screaming for
1.4 seconds at a frequency exceeding ████ Hz. Approximately 0.6
seconds after the anomalous state commenced, Mr. ███████ dropped
SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 in surprise, causing it to abruptly enter
its active state upon contact with the ground. Vibrations successfully
pierced Mr. ███████'s noise containment suit. After contamination, Mr.
███████ was taken to █████ for further study. Despite mistreatment by
Mr. ███████, SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 were unharmed.


Test 7

Date: ██/██/20██

Operator: ██████ ████

Procedure: After donning the provided noise containment suit, Ms. ████
entered the chamber, removed SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 from their
soundproof box, and began operation.

Music: The violin solo from SCP-012's first movement.

Results: During operation by Ms. ████, SCP-1301 rendered the piece in
a shrill, unsteady cackle, emitting harmonizing frequencies below ██
Hz. The object produced intelligible speech during operation,
including references to [DATA EXPUNGED]. The information provided
might bear relevance to SCP-████. Ms. ████ ceased operation of
SCP-1301-1 with SCP-1301-2 at 46 seconds, gingerly replaced both
objects into the box, and immediately fled from the chamber in a state
of hysteria. Ms. ████ was subsequently administered a Class A amnestic
and has since demonstrated no significant psychological scarring.


Test 9

Date: ██/██/20██

Operator: ██████ ████

Procedure: After donning the provided noise containment suit, Mr. ████
entered the chamber, removed SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 from their
soundproof box, and began operation.

Music: Scrap of notation from Mr. ███████, written following the
events of Test 1.

Results: SCP-1301-1 rendered the notation as intelligible speech in
Mr. ███████'s voice. Transcript follows: "Please get me— Oh, God! Why
can't I write?!"
