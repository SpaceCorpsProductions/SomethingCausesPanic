Item #: SCP-3035 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: All known instances of SCP-3035 are contained in 
Site-173 (a decommissioned Foundation site). Site-173 has two entry points: 
Entry A and Entry B. 

Entry A, the primary entrance, has been buried beneath 4 meters of concrete. 
Entry B, a vacuum-tube transit system, is used for deliveries to and from the 
interior of Site-173. MTF Nu-13 ("Rasczak's Roughnecks") is to maintain a 
provisional base at Entry B. They are to terminate any instance of SCP-3035 on 
sight. 

Approximately once a week, a package will emerge from Entry B's vacuum-tube 
system. Typically, this package will contain various non-anomalous materials 
(see below). Each package is to be placed in quarantine, where it is to be 
examined, documented, and then incinerated. 

Entry into Site-173 is prohibited until further notice. 

Description: SCP-3035 is a strain of Periplaneta americana (American cockroach, 
or water-bug) that mimics the behavior and outward appearance of organisms it 
observes. 

This mimicry is superficial. For example: While an instance of SCP-3035 may 
reproduce the coloration and behavior patterns of bumblebees, they will not 
reproduce a bee's complex social network or unique form of communication. 

Instances of SCP-3035 will mimic each other more rapidly than other organisms. 
This leads to a feedback loop: One instance will adopt a new attribute, only for 
all other instances to immediately mimic the first instance, acquiring the 
attribute for themselves. 

It should be emphasized that this mimicry is only a shallow approximation — an 
attempt by some as-of-yet unknown process to 'look' and 'act' like something 
else. Regardless of the extent of this mimicry, instances of SCP-3035 still 
retain many of the characteristics associated with cockroaches.

SUBJECT: Unusual Behavior 

We noticed something while finishing up with the latest batteries of tests. The 
SCP-3035 instances have adopted a new behavior — they'll stand along the edge 
of their enclosure, 'tapping' their forelegs against the glass. We're not sure 
where this behavior came from; it's not something exhibited in any of the 
insects we're training them to mimic.

TO: Dr. Xao <hxao@scp.foundation> 

SUBJECT: New Developments 

We figured it out. They're mimicking me. 

Nearly every day, I've been sitting down besides their enclosure, starting up my 
computer, and tapping away at the keyboard for twenty minutes. And now they've 
adopted my behavior — 'sitting up' and 'typing' at the glass. 

We previously presumed these organisms only mimicked other insects; clearly, we 
were wrong. This ability appears to extend to any creature they can observe.

SUBJECT: My New Research Staff? 

Per your suggestion, I've moved the enclosure to a spot where my 'colleagues' 
can watch my work with greater ease. They've proven to be very apt students — 
already, I've observed them mimicking the motions I make when I'm taking notes 
or preparing solutions for testing. I've even noticed a few of them flopping 
around in a rather clumsy attempt to walk. 

There's one other issue — they've gotten bigger. An increase of about 15%, 
according to my measurements. It occurred so slowly I didn't even think to 
measure them until I reviewed past footage and noticed the increase in size. 

Regardless, my new star pupils are starting to grow on me.

SUBJECT: Walking 

They're walking. They're walking! 

All of them, all at once — it happened like magic. Yesterday, they were just 
thumping around clumsily, and today… I walk into the lab and find them all 
strolling about the enclosure. Like they own the place. Or… like a buzzing 
little classroom of pre-graduate students awaiting their Professor. 

The curious part is that every test I've performed on them still indicates that 
they have the intelligence of your basic, run-of-the-mill cockroach. They can 
mimic behavior, but they can't mimic understanding; they copy my actions, but 
they don't understand why I do something. Or even what something means.

SUBJECT: Case of the Mondays 

As an experiment, I found some doll-sized tables and chairs and placed them 
inside the enclosure. The props are far too large, but I was curious if they'll 
try using them. 

And, well… If you've ever wanted to know what a bunch of cockroaches sitting 
at an over-sized table, typing away at keyboards that aren't even there looks 
like… I've attached a video that should satisfy your curiosity. 

I even got one of them to 'drink' from a tiny toy coffee mug 
(case_of_the_mondays.png).

SUBJECT: Re: Biopsy Time! 

Per your request, I performed a biopsy on their nervous system. I've sent the 
results to you — as you can see, there's no new growth, no new structures — 
they're still just cockroaches. Bizarrely large cockroaches that walk around. 
And type at empty desks. And pretend to drink coffee. 

I felt a little bad about killing one of them; it's hard not to think of them as 
my little pupils. Still, none of the others seemed to mind. They're all just 
happily strutting about, acting like nothing even happened.

They killed one of their own. 

This morning, I returned to the lab only to find one of the cockroaches on its 
back atop of the table, dead. It had been somehow — sliced open and gutted. 
The other cockroaches were just strutting around like nothing was wrong. 

I reviewed the footage from yesterday. Last night, after I left, one of them 
pinned another one down on top of the table. It used what looked like… 
sharpened tips on its forelegs to cut it open. Then, it started methodically 
removing the still-living bug's fatty tissues. Like it was scooping up 
ice-cream. 

Once it was done, it sat at the table and started tapping away at the invisible 
keyboard again. Like it was taking notes and writing emails based on the 
results. 

Just like me. 

They saw my autopsy, Dr. Xao. They saw it, and then they mimicked it. 

I think this experiment has gone on far enough.

TO WHOMEVER IT MAY CONCERN: 

After three disastrous attempts at a rescue mission, we're giving up. Every time 
we send a squad of soldiers down there, these things start adapting their 
behavior and appearance — becoming more and more aggressive. On top of that, 
they breed like… well, cockroaches. 

Nu-13 will be stationed at Entry B; they'll stay as long as they can and wait to 
see if anything human comes out. But as of this moment, I'm declaring Site-173 a 
lost cause. 

The decision regarding whether or not to deploy nerve-toxins to clear Site-173 
of SCP-3035 instances is under review — particularly in light of the recent 
revelation that some of the human organs emerging from Entry B are fresh.

SCP-3035 Exploration Log

The following audio log describes events on 03/26/2007, involving MTF
Gamma-3 ("Three Wolf Moon") during the Foundation's initial attempts
to re-establish contact with Site-173 following a catastrophic
containment breach.

<Begin Log.>

MOON: Role-call.

WOLF 1: Wolf 1, here.

WOLF 2: Wolf 2, awwrrroooooooo!

WOLF 3: Wolf 3, caaawwrroooooo-kie crisps!

MOON: Alright, enough dicking around. Control, you receiving this?

CONTROL: Loud and clear.

MOON: Good. Alright, we're opening the entrance.

(Pneumatic hissing; sound of metal grinding.)

MOON: Respirators on. Stay sharp.

WOLF 2: (gagging) …Jesus. I can almost smell this through my skin.

MOON: Lighting is low, the floor… covered with some sort of sludge.
Brown-black. Garbage everywhere — crumpled cardboard boxes, office
supplies… uh, looks like — some rotting meat, too…

CONTROL: Understood. Remember, Commander, your primary mission is just
recon. Rescue any personnel you can, but do not put yourself or your
team in jeopardy.

MOON: Understood. Holy fuck, this place is disgusting. Wolf 1, stay by
the door. Anything not-human tries to get out…

WOLF 1: Light it up. Got it.

MOON: Proceeding forward. Wolf 2, Wolf 3, with me.

MOON: Control panel on the other side's got some bloody hand-prints on
it. Looks like somebody tried to escape.

WOLF 3: Fuck.

MOON: Keep moving.

WOLF 2: Up ahead!

MOON: Put your fucking hands up! Are you human? Talk!

UNIDENTIFIED: (muffled, distant) Help…

WOLF 2: Is that a friendly?

WOLF 3: Sounds hurt.

MOON: Don't move. Control, looks like… about 15 yards up, a technician
in a lab-coat. On his knees. S'got some blood on him, he might be
hurt—

CONTROL: Be careful.

MOON: Approaching. Hey! Hey. Talk to me, man. We're here to get you
out, but you need to talk to me.

UNIDENTIFIED: (muffled) Stop…

MOON: Gonna need to give me more than that, buddy. Alright? Relax.
Keep your hands up. Tell me your name. What's your name?

UNIDENTIFIED: (muffled) Please, no…

MOON: Oh. Oh, shit.

WOLF 3: What's going on? You alright?

MOON: Stay where you are! Nobody fucking move, just… stay calm.
Control?

CONTROL: Come back.

MOON: Control, I think this is one of the roaches.

CONTROL: Wait. You said it was a lab technician—

MOON: At a distance, it looked like — look, its face is just, like… a
chitin-mask. And it's…

CONTROL: What is it doing?

UNIDENTIFIED: (distorted, muffled sobbing sounds)

MOON: I think… it looks like… it's begging?

WOLF 2: Down the hall!

(distant radio chirping sounds)

MOON: Shit — two of them, big ones, they—

(distant, angry, garbled roaring sounds)

(gunfire)

WOLF 3: Fuck!

WOLF 2: Contact! Contact!

MOON: Take cover!

(gunfire stops)

WOLF 1: Am I holding position?

MOON: Yes, hold position — everyone alright? Anyone hit?

WOLF 3: Negative, I'm good.

WOLF 2: We both got cover.

MOON: Fuck. Fuck. Since when do these things have—

(gunfire)

MOON: Fuck!

(gunfire continues)

MOON: …what the hell?

(gunfire continues)

MOON: What the hell?

WOLF 3: Are you alright, Moon?!

MOON: Stay where you are. Stay where you are, both of you.

(gunfire continues)

MOON: (laughing) Well, now I've seen everything.

WOLF 2: What is it?

MOON: Goddamn roaches.

(six more shots, distinctly louder and clearer)

(gunfire ceases)

MOON: Hallway's clear.

WOLF 3: What just happened?

MOON: They don't have guns. They've got gun-shaped hands. They were
waving them around and making gunshot noises.

WOLF 2: Are you… are you shitting me?

WOLF 3: That's fucking hilarious.

MOON: You catch all that, Control? Please advise.

CONTROL: Affirmative. Proceed with caution.

MOON: Proceeding. Wolf 2, Wolf 3, on point.

WOLF 3: Jesus. How the hell did these things compromise a site?

MOON: Up ahead. You see that?

WOLF 2: Barricade.

WOLF 3: Survivors?

MOON: Could be. C'mon.

WOLF 2: Supplies, looks like — yeah, this looks recent, too. Managed
to hold up a fort against the bugs.

WOLF 3: Hey! — look, is that —

MOON: Hey! Hey, hands up, start talking—

WOLF 2: Fuck. She's running away—

WOLF 3: Is that a survivor? Or is it—

MOON: Fucking… it's hard to tell in this light. She went into the
bathroom. Wolf 2, with me. Wolf 3, take point on the entrance — don't
want to end up pinned inside there.

WOLF 3: Copy.

MOON: Let's take it easy, now…

(door opening)

WOLF 2: Jesus.

(soft, muffled whimpering)

MOON: Hey. Hey, you there? We're humans. We're here to take you home.
Just come out, hands up, okay…?

(whimpering grows more pronounced)

MOON: She's in the back stall, I think.

WOLF 2: Moon, there's a body in this stall, over here—

WOLF 3: Hey! Hey, you! Hands up! Come over here — we're the rescue
team! We're — shit!

MOON: Wolf 3? What's going on?

WOLF 3: Fuck. Fuck. I just saw — somebody down the hall, on our side
of the barricade. They saw me, then started running away—

MOON: Human?

WOLF 3: I… I think so, yeah, I saw the face, it looked human, but they
ran—

MOON: Alright, let's finish in here, and—

(ear-piercing scream)

(scuffling, shouts)

WOLF 2: Fuck! Fuck!

(two gunshots)

WOLF 2: Fucking… FUCK!

MOON: Calm down. Calm down. Let me look at it.

WOLF 2: It was… Jesus-fuck.

WOLF 3: You alright in there?

MOON: Roach in the stall. Wolf 2 got stabbed, doesn't look critical.

WOLF 2: You know this shit is going to get infected—

MOON: Relax. We're getting out of here. Control, you copy?

CONTROL: Come back.

MOON: One of our team got stabbed. One of the roaches, it had… a
knife-hand, or something. I'm pulling us out for now.

CONTROL: Affirmative.

WOLF 3: What about — I saw someone, back there—

MOON: You saw another roach.

WOLF 3: I'm pretty sure I saw—

MOON: You saw another roach, Wolf 3. Do you understand?

MOON: I said, do you understand?

WOLF 3: Affirmative.

MOON: Alright. We're pulling out. C'mon, I'll help you up—

(scuffling sounds)

WOLF 2: Christ.

UNIDENTIFIED: Goddamn… roaches…

WOLF 3: You catch that?

MOON: Where's that coming from?

UNIDENTIFIED: (multiple, chanting) Goddamn… roaches…

WOLF 3: Oh… oh, shit. Moon, get out here right now.

(door opening)

MOON: What — holy shit.

UNIDENTIFIED: (over a dozen, chanting) Goddamn… roaches…

WOLF 3: They're just… claws and teeth—

(smashing sounds, objects rattling)

WOLF 2: Fuck! Fuck, they're slamming into the barricade—

WOLF 3: What the fuck did they mimic?!

UNIDENTIFIED: (dozens more, chanting) Goddamn… roaches…

(smashing sounds intensify)

MOON: Open fire! Open fire!

(gunfire)

WOLF 3: Shit!

MOON: Throwing a grenade! Get down!

UNIDENTIFIED: Goddamn… roaches…

(muffled explosion)

MOON: Keep—(static)

UNIDENTIFIED: Goddamn… roaches…

WOLF 2: Fucking stabbed me fucking—(static)

MOON: Wolf 3, do you—(static)

WOLF 3: (brief scream, ended on static)

MOON: Contr—(static)

WOLF 1: Fuck! I'm going in! Moon, do you read?

MOON: S—(static)

CONTROL: Wolf 1, maintain position. Nu-13 is coming to get you and
secure the entrance.

WOLF 1: Fuck you. I'm going the fuck in.

CONTROL: Negative, Wolf 1, maintain your—

WOLF 1: I said FUCK YOU.

UNIDENTIFIED: (distant) Goddamn… roaches…

WOLF 1: Jesusfuck. There's…

CONTROL: Wolf 1, get out of there.

WOLF 1: There's gotta be almost a hundred of — wait, I think I see —
Moon, do you read?

(static)

WOLF 1: Moon! Do you copy? Moon, is that you? Moon!

(distant, garbled screams)

WOLF 1: That was — it was Moon, I swear it was Moon, I saw his
uniform, that had to have been… Moon! Moon! Come back! Moon!

CONTROL: Wolf 1, come back.

WOLF 1: Fucking… I can't — there's — Moon!

(gunshots)

CONTROL: Wolf 1, come back. Is that you firing?

UNIDENTIFIED: Moon! Come back! Moon!

(gunshots)

CONTROL: Wolf 1, come back.

(gunshots)

CONTROL: Wolf 1, do you read?

(gunshots)

CONTROL: Wolf 1, are you there?

WOLF 1: I'm here. I've got Moon and Wolf 2 with me. Their comms are
toast. Wolf 3 is dead. On our way out.

CONTROL: Copy. Epsilon-9 is on their way.
