                                    --------                                    

Item #: SCP-860 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-860 is to be contained in a small wooden box 
in a vault at Sector-██. By itself, the object is inert, and no further 
containment procedures are needed. 

Description: SCP-860 is a dark blue key of unremarkable shape. At seemingly 
random intervals of time, a series of numbers, later found to be UTM 
coordinates, will appear on the key's blade. In the time SCP-860 has spent under 
containment, the numbers have changed three times, giving the coordinates for 
██████ (Germany), ██████ (England), and Site-██. 

SCP-860 can fit in any door lock that requires a key located in the area of the 
given coordinates, and will function identically to the correct key for that 
lock. SCP-860 only works on door locks, and only if they are attached to a door; 
it will not work on any other type of locking device. 

When SCP-860 is used to unlock and open a door, the door does not lead to its 
usual destination. Instead, it opens into a small forest clearing centered on an 
80 cm wide footpath, designated SCP-860-1. Every observation of this grove has 
noted the presence of blue-colored mist. 

As soon as any person enters SCP-860-1, the door automatically closes. From 
inside SCP-860-1, the door appears attached to an infinite concrete wall, and is 
locked. No attempts to break the door from outside, with personnel inside 
SCP-860-1, have been successful. Attempts to break the door from inside 
SCP-860-1 have resulted in [REDACTED]. See Document 860-III for more details. 

The trail inside SCP-860-1 usually leads to another door attached to another 
infinite concrete wall. This second door leads to the normal destination room of 
the door on which SCP-860 was used. 

A number of other anomalous events have been reported by personnel conducting 
explorations of SCP-860-1. These are explained in more detail in Documents 860-I 
through 860-IV. 

Following the events of Exploration IV (described in Document 860-IV), only 
level 4 personnel may perform tests on SCP-860. 

Incident 860-██-12: On ██/██/████, ██ days after 
Exploration IV, SCP-860 was found on Dr. ███'s office table, ████ 
m from its containment unit. The item's containment locker had not been opened. 
Video surveillance from ██:██ AM shows the key suddenly materializing on 
top of the table. It is currently unknown how or why SCP-860 was moved. The 
incident had a profound effect on Dr. ███. Psychiatric evaluation is 
recommended. 


Addendum: Below are the transcripts of Explorations I - IV. Level 2 personnel 
and above may access Documents 860-I and II. Only level 4 personnel and above 
may access Document 860-III and IV. 


Document 860-I and II 

Below are the transcripts of exploration I and II into SCP-860-1.

Exploration I realized on ██/██/████.

Exploration II realized on ██/██/████.

Exploration I

(D-3456 is a 31-year old Caucasian male of average build.
Psychological background is unremarkable. Class-D designation is the
result of a demotion due to [DATA EXPUNGED]. D-3456 is equipped with
an LED flashlight, a handheld camcorder fitted with a transmission
stream, and an audio headset for communication with Dr. ███ at
Control.)

D-3456 inserts SCP-860 in the door leading to an abandoned house on
████████████ Street, ██████, Germany. He turns the key and opens the
door, revealing SCP-860-1. D-3456 staggers.

Dr. ███: Please proceed.

D-3456 hesitates, then passes through the door. After he takes two
steps, a loud bang is heard. D-3456 turns quickly. The door is closed
and attached to a large concrete wall. D-3456 moves towards it and
attempts to turn the knob.

D-3456: ████, this ████ is locked! How the hell'm I supposed to—

Dr. ███: Please follow the trail, D-3456. The exit should be on the
other side.

D-3456 sighs, then turns around and walks down the trail. After
walking 64 meters, D-3456 stops.

D-3456: Did you hear that?

Dr. ███: No sound came through the audio feed.

D-3456: It sounded like… a howl… or… or something. Came from the
woods, seemed far away.

Dr. ███: A howl? Like a wolf?

D-3456: Not… exactly. Sounded weird. Distorted.

Dr. ███: Please proceed down the trail.

D-3456 starts walking again, with increased speed. After 43 meters,
the mist starts to thicken and acquire a deeper shade of blue.

D-3456: It's starting to get really hard to see here. This ███████ flashlight isn't—

D-3456 suddenly starts to turn around.

D-3456: [shouting] ████! ████! Did you hear it now?

Dr. ███: Nothing came through the audio feed, D-3456. What did you
hear?

D-3456: [shouting] Same thing as before! Closer! How the ████ didn't
you hear it, it was—

Dr. ███: Please continue to follow the trail, D-3456.

D-3456: [shouting] No, you don't get it, it—

A loud roar can be heard coming from D-3456's left. D-3456 screams and
starts running down the trail. Every ten seconds, the sound of steps
coming from behind D-3456 can be heard, starting off distant and
increasing in volume until they appear to be less than one meter from
D-3456, at which point they stop.

After running 68 more meters, D-3456 reaches a large concrete wall
with a door in it. D-3456 kicks the door open, revealing the main hall
of the abandoned house. D-3456 enters, turns around and closes the
door. Two minutes later, he opens the door again, revealing
████████████ Street. D-3456 shows extreme paranoia for the following
weeks, claiming to hear the same howl in the distance when alone.
Effects seemed to fade after ██ weeks. D-3456 now behaves normally.

Close analysis of the audio feed revealed that a very low sound could
be heard the second time D-3456 stopped. The sound file containing the
amplified sound can be found here.


Exploration II

(D-5674 is a 27-year old South Asian female of below-average physical
fitness. Psychological background indicates extreme xenophobia.
Subject has an extensive record of [DATA EXPUNGED]. D-5674 is equipped
with an LED flashlight, a handheld camcorder fitted with a
transmission stream, and an audio headset for communication with Dr.
███ at Control.)

D-5674 inserts SCP-860 in the door leading to an abandoned house on
████████████ Street, ██████, Germany. She turns the key and open the
door, revealing SCP-860-1. D-5674 passes through the door. After she
takes two steps, a loud bang is heard. D-5674 turns. The door is
closed and attached to a large concrete wall.

D-5674: [EXPLETIVE REDACTED]

Dr. ███: Follow the trail, D-5674. The exit is on the other side.

D-5674 turns around and walks down the trail. After 94 meters, D-5674
stops and turns to the woods.

D-5674: Did you… did you see that?

Dr. ███: What?

D-5674: Did you see those… those…

Dr. ███: …yes?

D-5674 is silent.

Dr. ███: What did you see?

D-5674 does not respond. Twelve seconds later, she resumes walking
down the trail.

Dr. ███: D-5674, please report what you saw, we need—

D-5674: It was nothing. Mist must've tricked me.

D-5674 walks for 10 more meters before stopping again.

Dr. ███: D-5674, why did you stop?

D-5674: [low monotone] Silence… can't you hear it?

Dr. ███: What?

D-5674: [low monotone] It's calling me… I have to… I have to go…

Dr. ███: D-5674, you can't—

D-5674 removes the headset and puts the camera on the ground, facing
the trees. She proceeds to walk off the trail, into the woods, until
she disappears from sight. Nothing more happens until the camera's
batteries run down.


Addendum: The door leading to the abandoned house remained closed.
Attempts to remove the key from the lock failed, as did all attempts
to open or break the door. Seven months after the incident, the door
suddenly opened and discharged a very old Asian woman. When
questioned, she affirmed herself to be D-5674. She refused to
elaborate on what happened after she left the camera on the ground,
even under extreme pressure. Subject was found to be much calmer and
more polite than before Exploration II, and, apart from talking about
what occurred to her inside SCP-860-1, followed every order issued to
her without complaints. Two weeks later, she died in her sleep of
natural causes.


Document 860-III and IV

Below are the transcripts of exploration III and IV into SCP-860-1.

Exploration III realized on █/██/████.

Exploration IV realized on ██/██/████.


Exploration III

(D-2562 is a 35-year old Caucasian male of strong build. Psychological
background indicates [DATA EXPUNGED]. Subject shows a record of
violent behavior under pressure and is responsible for the murder of
██ people. D-2562 is equipped with an LED flashlight, a handheld
camcorder fitted with a transmission stream, an audio headset for
communication with Dr. ███ at Control, and a fire axe.)

D-2562 inserts SCP-860 in the door leading to the house of Mr.
███████, located on ██████ Street, ██████, England. He turns the key
and opens the door, revealing SCP-860-1. D-2562 hesitates, then
proceeds through the door. After he takes two steps, a loud bang is
heard. D-2562 turns. The door is closed and attached to a large
concrete wall.

D-2562: Now… what?

Dr. ███: Please use the axe provided to try to destroy the door.

D-2562: Uh… you sure?

Dr. ███: Please do as instructed.

D-2562 places the camera on the ground, facing himself and the wall,
and proceeds to hit the door with the axe. He hits the door four times
before quickly turning around.

D-2562: ████! Did you hear that?

Dr. ███: No sound came through the audio feed.

D-2562: It was a ███████ loud roar, man, how could you not—

Dr. ███: Please calm down and proceed with your task.

D-2562 keeps looking at the woods.

Dr. ███: D-2562, please remember our agreement. If you don't follow
our instructions—

D-2562: Yeah, I know that, it's just… OK… OK, no problem…

D-2562 resumes his attempts at destroying the door. After he has hit
the door twice, a small piece of wood breaks off. Seemingly encouraged
by this, D-2562 proceeds to hit the door harder. After nine blows, an
extremely loud roar is heard. D-2562 screams and starts swinging the
axe in the direction of the camera. A large [DATA EXPUNGED] paw
appears in front of the lens. D-2562 charges, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. The
sounds of [DATA EXPUNGED] could be heard for ██ hours after that, long
after the camera batteries ran out, and showed no signs of stopping.
Dr. ███ decided to cut the audio feed after ██ hours.


Exploration IV

(█████ (from now on referred to as Subject-1) is a 41-year old
African-American male of above-average build. Psychological background
shows no abnormalities. Subject volunteered for the exploration.
Subject-1 is equipped with an LED flashlight, a handheld camcorder
fitted with a transmission stream, and an audio headset for
communication with Dr. ███ at Control.)

Subject-1 inserts SCP-860 in the door leading to an empty room in
Site-██. He turns the key and opens the door, revealing SCP-860-1.
Subject-1 proceeds through the door. After he takes two steps, a loud
bang is heard.

Subject-1: The door just closed, no?

Dr. ███: Yes. Please follow the trail. The exit will be on the other
side.

Subject-1 proceeds to walk down the trail. The grove shows notable
differences from previous explorations; the mist has acquired a slight
red hue, and incomprehensible murmurs are heard through the audio
feed, although Subject-1 seems unaware of them. Subject walks for 123
meters.

Subject-1: Place seems different from what you described, Doc. It's
giving me the— Wait. The hell?

Subject stops. In front of him, the trail forks into two paths, one of
which is made of cobblestones.

Subject-1: Uhhh, Doc? Which… which way should I go?

Dr. ███: This… er, this is new. We haven't seen it manifest like this
before.

Subject-1: …well, I guess I'll — [shouting] Oh, ████!

Subject-1 turns around. The trail has disappeared; thousands of trees
have replaced it. The mist suddenly turns [DATA EXPUNGED], and the
murmurs increase in volume.

Subject-1: [shouting] ████, Doc, what the ████ is going on here? What
is this noise?

Dr. ███: Please calm down and proceed down the cobblestone trail.

Subject-1: I'm not a ███████ guinea pig, Doc, just because I
volunteered I don't— [shouting] Oh my God!

Dr. ███: What? █████, respond, what do you see?

Subject-1 starts screaming and proceeds to run through the cobblestone
path. The murmurs suddenly cease, and only Subject-1's screams can be
heard. He runs 143 meters before the camera is suddenly thrown into
the ground. Subject-1's screams cease. The camera is turned towards
the woods. The mist is now thick enough to block sight completely
beyond two meters.

Dr. ███: █████, do you hear me?

Subject-1: [DATA EXPUNGED]

Dr. ███: █████?

Subject-1: [DATA EXPUNGED]

Dr. ███: Oh God.

There is no further response from Subject-1. Three seconds before the
camera's battery ran out, a very low noise was heard. Analysis of the
video feed showed two glowing yellow spheres for one frame in the last
second of the video. The sound was later amplified, and can be heard
here. At the suggestion of Dr. ███, the sound was reversed: the
modified file can be heard here.
