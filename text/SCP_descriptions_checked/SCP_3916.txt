Item #: SCP-3916 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: One small swarm of SCP-3916 is contained in a 
standard biological containment cell at Site-121. It is to be fed daily with 
500kg of fresh plant matter. Excess instances (past roughly 1500) are to be 
terminated as necessary. Any instances that escape containment are to be 
terminated by conventional means, such as fire or insecticide. Any personnel 
wishing to conduct experiments on SCP-3916 should contact its current head 
researcher. 

Wild instances of SCP-3916 should be eradicated immediately and thoroughly, 
unless otherwise notified. The Foundation is currently cooperating with the 
government of the United States of America (through the cover of LARPA, see 
Addendum) to capture, kill, or otherwise contain all wild SCP-3916 instances, as 
they have been recognized to pose a significant threat to humanity at large. MTF 
δ-17 "Metarhizium" is to be notified of any outstanding reports of SCP-3916. 

Description: SCP-3916 is a species of insect that physically resembles 
Chortoicetes terminifera (Australian Plague Locust). However, SCP-3916 has two 
anomalous traits of particular note. 

First, SCP-3916 eats at an alarming rate. A single instance is able to consume 
roughly 100g of matter per second. SCP-3916 has only been found to eat fresh 
plant matter. 

Second, SCP-3916 reproduce unusually quickly, and do so asexually. An instance 
of SCP-3916 will grow visually larger as it consumes more food, and after a 
certain size threshold, split into two instances of SCP-3916. Both new instances 
will be fully-formed adults. Each "cloning" takes a significant amount of 
consumption, currently estimated at 500g of food. However, due to its eating 
speed, SCP-3916 swarms grow very quickly. 

History: The Foundation was first made aware of the existence of SCP-3916 when a 
small swarm of them escaped the captivity of GoI-466 ("Wilson's Wildlife 
Services") in a transportation accident in Maupin, Oregon, along US Route 26. 
GoI-466 contacted the Foundation for assistance in containment, and the majority 
of the SCP-3916 instances were captured or eliminated. GoI-466 informed the 
Foundation of the nature of SCP-3916, and the few instances that remained 
uncontained were deemed to pose a significant threat. The uncontained instances 
of SCP-3916 spread rapidly across Oregon and into California, prompting the 
United States of America's government to take action, and leading to the 
formation of LARPA. 


Addendum - LARPA: Due to the nature of SCP-3916, the Foundation determined that 
it would be overly difficult to eliminate wild instances without alerting the 
general public. Thus, the Foundation contacted the USA government and negotiated 
the formation of LARPA (Locust Active Removal and Prevention Agency), an 
official government organization funded and staffed entirely by the Foundation. 
LARPA serves as a front through which the Foundation can openly take action 
against wild SCP-3916. Site-121, the current containment site of SCP-3916, has 
been designated as LARPA headquarters.

Item #: SCP-3916

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: One small swarm of SCP-3916-1 is
contained in a standard biological containment cell at Site-121. It is
to be fed daily with 500kg of fresh plant matter. Excess instances
(past roughly 1500) are to be terminated as necessary. Any instances
that escape containment are to be terminated by conventional means,
such as fire or insecticide. Any personnel wishing to conduct
experiments on SCP-3916 should contact its current head researcher.
Personnel entering SCP-3916-1's containment chamber are to wear
class-4A or higher protective equipment.

Wild instances of SCP-3916 should be eradicated immediately and
thoroughly, unless otherwise notified. The Foundation is currently
cooperating with the government of the United States of America
(through the cover of LARPA, see Addendum) to capture, kill, or
otherwise contain all wild SCP-3916 instances, as they have been
recognized to pose a significant threat to humanity at large. MTF δ-17
"Metarhizium" is to be notified of any outstanding reports of
SCP-3916.

Based on previous and projected damage, any uncontrolled population of
SCP-3916-1 is likely to cause a Class-ARBH event. All Level 3 and
higher personnel dealing with SCP-3916 are to read the ARBH-Class
Event Debriefing File.

Description: SCP-3916 is a species of insect that physically resembles
Chortoicetes terminifera (Australian Plague Locust). There are two
subspecies of SCP-3916, designated SCP-3916-0 and SCP-3916-1. All
instances of SCP-3916-1 are currently contained at Site-121, while all
wild instances are of subspecies 0. SCP-3916 has two anomalous traits
of particular note.

First, SCP-3916 eats at an alarming rate. A single instance is able to
consume roughly 100g of matter per second. SCP-3916-0 has only been
found to eat fresh plant matter, while SCP-3916-1 can eat fresh plant
and animal matter.

Second, SCP-3916 reproduce unusually quickly, and do so asexually. An
instance of SCP-3916 will grow visually larger as it consumes more
food, and after a certain size threshold, split into two instances of
SCP-3916. Both new instances will be fully-formed adults. Each
"cloning" takes a significant amount of consumption, currently
estimated at 500g of food. However, due to its eating speed, SCP-3916
swarms grow very quickly.

History: The Foundation was first made aware of the existence of
SCP-3916 when a small swarm of them escaped the captivity of GoI-466

uncontained were deemed to pose a significant threat. The uncontained
instances of SCP-3916 spread rapidly across Oregon and into
California, prompting the United States of America's government to
take action, and leading to the formation of LARPA.

SCP-3916-1's ability to consume animal matter is currently presumed to
be a mutation accidentally induced during experimentation. This
development was observed during Incident 3916-A, during which a
researcher entered SCP-3916's containment chamber, and was attacked
and eaten. No such mutations have been seen in the wild SCP-3916, and
as such the instances contained at Site-121 and the wild instances are
currently considered separate subspecies.


Addendum - LARPA: Due to the nature of SCP-3916, the Foundation
determined that it would be overly difficult to eliminate wild
instances without alerting the general public. Thus, the Foundation

Item #: SCP-3916

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: One small swarm of SCP-3916-1 is
contained in a modified biological containment cell at Provisional
Site-136. All exposed surfaces in the containment cell are to be
covered in at least 1cm of solid hardened glass. The cell is to be
inspected daily, and any damage repaired immediately. A minimum of two
identical backup containment cells are to be maintained for use during
repairs.

The swarm is to be fed daily with 500kg of fresh plant matter. Excess
instances (past roughly 1500) are to be terminated as necessary. Any
instances that escape containment are to be terminated by fire. In the
case of a partial containment breach at Provisional Site-136, MTF δ-17
is to help re-contain or terminate the escaped instances while the
site is being evacuated; if a full containment breach occurs,
Provisional Site-136 is to be destroyed via its built-in nuclear
warhead. Any personnel wishing to conduct experiments on SCP-3916
should contact its current head researcher. Personnel entering
SCP-3916-1's containment chamber are to wear class-12G protective
equipment.

Wild instances of SCP-3916 should be eradicated immediately and
thoroughly, unless otherwise notified. The Foundation is currently
cooperating with the government of the United States of America
(through the cover of LARPA, see Addendum) to capture, kill, or
otherwise contain all wild SCP-3916 instances, as they have been

Description: SCP-3916 is a species of insect that physically resembles
Chortoicetes terminifera (Australian Plague Locust). There are two
subspecies of SCP-3916, designated SCP-3916-0 and SCP-3916-1. All
instances of SCP-3916-1 are currently contained at Site-121, while all
wild instances are SCP-3916-0. SCP-3916 has two anomalous behavioural
traits of particular note.

First, SCP-3916 eats at an alarming rate. A single instance is able to
consume roughly 100g of matter per second. SCP-3916-0 has only been
found to eat fresh plant matter, while SCP-3916-1 can eat almost any
matter, with the only known exception being silicon-based glass.
SCP-3916-1 seems to prefer fresh organic matter over other matter.

Second, SCP-3916 reproduce unusually quickly, and do so asexually. An
instance of SCP-3916 will grow visually larger as it consumes more
food, and after a certain size threshold, split into two instances of
SCP-3916. Both new instances will be fully-formed adults. Each
"cloning" takes a significant amount of consumption, currently
estimated at 500g of food (SCP-3916-1 can consume non-organic matter
but must consume organic matter to reproduce). However, due to its
eating speed, SCP-3916 swarms grow very quickly.

SCP-3916-1 has developed a remarkable resistance to chemical-based
attacks such as poisons or corrosive substances, likely as a side
effect of its ability to consume them. It is completely immune to all
conventional chemical attacks, and highly resistant against
Foundation-engineered and anomalous substances. Physical force is also
unreliable as SCP-3916-1 can eat through any weapons used against them
(glass-based weapons have not been found to be practical). The most
reliable ways to eliminate SCP-3916-1 are currently intense heat and
radiation.

History: The Foundation was first made aware of the existence of
SCP-3916 when a small swarm of them escaped the captivity of GoI-466
("Wilson's Wildlife Services") in a transportation accident in in
Maupin, Oregon, along US Route 26. GoI-466 contacted the Foundation

SCP-3916-1's ability to consume non-organic substances is believed to
be a spontaneous mutation. This development was first noticed when the
inside of SCP-3916-1's containment chamber suffered repeated damage,
prompting review of surveillance footage. Videos showed SCP-3916-1
seemingly eating at the chamber's walls. This ability, and the
inability of SCP-3916-1 to consume glass, were confirmed during
further testing.

Item #: SCP-3916

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Currently none. All SCP-3916 instances
in the Foundation's possession have breached containment.

All instances of SCP-3916 are to be exterminated immediately and
thoroughly. Extermination efforts are to focus on SCP-3916-1 instances
in particular. Personnel attempting to engage with SCP-3916-1 are to
observe the guidelines listed in Document 3916-K. The Foundation is
currently cooperating with various government agencies and GoIs to
ensure the complete destruction of SCP-3916.

At the time of writing, SCP-3916-1 is the cause of an active
ARBH-Class event. See the History section below for further details.
All Foundation personnel are to read the ARBH-Class Event Debriefing
File.

Description: SCP-3916 is a species of insect that physically resembles
Chortoicetes terminifera (Australian Plague Locust). There are two
subspecies of SCP-3916, designated SCP-3916-0 and SCP-3916-1. Both
subspecies currently exist outside of Foundation captivity. SCP-3916
has two anomalous behavioural traits of particular note.

First, SCP-3916 eats at an alarming rate. A single instance is able to
consume roughly 100g of matter per second. SCP-3916-0 has only been
found to eat fresh plant matter, while SCP-3916-1 can eat any form of
matter. SCP-3916-1 seems to prefer fresh organic matter over other
matter.

Second, SCP-3916 reproduce unusually quickly, and do so asexually. An
instance of SCP-3916 will grow visually larger as it consumes more
food, and after a certain size threshold, split into two instances of
SCP-3916. Both new instances will be fully-formed adults. Each

prompting review of surveillance footage. Videos showed SCP-3916-1
seemingly eating at the chamber's walls. This ability, and the
inability of SCP-3916-1 to consume glass, were confirmed during
further testing.

SCP-3916-1's ability to consume glass was discovered on July 25, 2022.
This ability is believed to be another spontaneous mutation, similar
to its previous one that allowed it to consume non-organic substances.
This development was noticed when the SCP-3916-1 instances contained
at Provisional Site-136 ate through their containment chamber's wall,
breaching containment. MTF δ-17 was mobilized, and though the events
that follow are currently unclear, they evidently failed to
exterminate or recapture the escaped instances. Provisional Site-136's
on-site nuclear warhead was manually detonated at 11:33 AM, and
successfully destroyed the site.

At 12:15 PM, LARPA received a distress call from Etna, California. The
caller claimed that their town was under assault from an unusually
aggressive group of locusts, and that several people had been eaten.
Foundation agents were deployed immediately. Upon arrival, agents
found that all people in the town had already been consumed, and the
SCP-3916-1 instances had left the area.

At 1:55 PM, the O5 council unanimously voted to declare an active
ARBH-class scenario, and initiated emergency protocols.

The current time of writing is 5:43 PM. The Foundation has received
reports of SCP-3916-1 ranging from Oregon to Colorado. Projections
suggest that at their current rate of growth, SCP-3916-1 will spread
across the entirety of the United States within eighteen hours, and
across the entire world within forty-eight hours.


Addendum - LARPA: Due to the nature of SCP-3916, the Foundation
determined that it would be overly difficult to eliminate wild
instances without alerting the general public. Thus, the Foundation
contacted the USA government and negotiated the formation of LARPA
(Locust Active Removal and Prevention Agency), an official government
organization funded and staffed entirely by the Foundation. LARPA
serves as a front through which the Foundation can openly take action
against wild SCP-3916. Site-121, the former containment site of
SCP-3916-1, has been designated as LARPA headquarters. Provisional
Site-136, the former containment site of SCP-3916-1, is designated
"Boromine Branch", and is an official LARPA site.


Addendum - Audio log:

- AUDIO LOG: July 25, 2022

< BEGIN LOG >

Stephen Chang: John, we need to get to somewhere safer. There's a
swarm of locusts headed toward us. We have an hour left at best.

Johnathan Morris: Wait. I have to finish updating the article.

Chang: Who are you even writing this for? You've seen what those
things can do, John. There won't be anyone left to read this.

Morris: There will be somebody left. There always has been, and there
always will be.

Chang: Please, John. Listen to me. Those things eat anything and they
won't stop until they've eaten everything. There's nothing we can do
except run and hide.

Morris: Bullshit. We are the Foundation. We are humanity's first and
last line of defense against what should not exist. I've been doing my
job for twenty-seven goddamn years and I've faced alien gods and
immortal reptiles and sentient ideas, and I'm still standing here
today. The Foundation has conquered all that and more. I refuse to
believe that we are going to get done in by a bunch of insects. So
shut up and watch the cameras. I have work to do.

Chang: (sighs) Okay. Just hurry up.

Morris: Thank you.

(typing)

Morris: Alright. That should do it.

Chang: You're done?

Morris: (exhales) Yeah. Let's pack up and get out of here.

(silence)

Chang: Hey, you know all that stuff you said earlier? About how we're
going to come out on top of all of this? Do you really believe that?

Morris: I do.

Chang: How can you look at these locusts and say we're going to be
fine? Remember Dr. Mattison? Those things ate him in seconds. And now
they eat through everything, John. How are we supposed to win?

Morris: We have no other choice. We have to win, Stephen, because if
we lose, there won't be anything left. I believe in the Foundation, in
humanity, because if I don't, all I have left is fear. And I refuse to
be afraid.

Chang: Heh. That's one heck of a reason. Well, I think that's
everything. Let's get go… Oh no. No no no, this can't be happening.

Morris: Stephen? What's wrong?

Chang: The… the locusts. Oh god, the locusts. They're here.

Morris: You said we had an hour!

Chang: An hour at best. But even then… They shouldn't be this fast.
Why are they so fast?

Morris: Okay. Okay, let's calm down and think. Where are the locusts
right now? Can we still get to the car?

Chang: No. No, they've already gotten to it. That was our only way
out. We're going to die, aren't we? I don't want to die, John. Oh god,
I don't want to die like this.

Morris: Shit. Shit, goddammit. Of all the times… (sighs)

Okay, look at me, Stephen. Remember what I just said about not being
afraid. If we die here today, I want you to promise me that you will
die believing that we will win. Because we will. Even if these locusts
eat every last leaf on this godforsaken planet, even if there's
nothing left but dirt and rocks, we will win. Promise me that you
believe.

Chang: I… I don't know, John. I'm scared. I don't want to die here…

Morris: But here we are. What you want doesn't matter anymore,
Stephen. All that matters now is what you do.

Chang: But what can we do?

Morris: We still have our weapons. I figure the two of us together are
worth 300, maybe 350 of those locusts. If we kill any more than that,
it's our victory. Do you think you can do this, Stephen?

Chang: (silence) Yeah. I believe I can.

Morris: That's the spirit. Now come on, those tiny bastards aren't
going to torch themselves.
