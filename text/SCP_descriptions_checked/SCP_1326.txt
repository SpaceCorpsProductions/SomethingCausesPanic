Item #: SCP-1326 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1326 is to be contained in a standard 
Site-19 containment cell, with a box of used literature (e.g. newspapers or 
magazines) kept outside its cell. One magazine from this box is to be left 
within the SCP's containment cell as a precaution, and must be replaced pending 
"feedings'. Every 3 weeks, a staff member is to "feed" the SCP by bringing the 
book kept inside the containment cell within 30cm of the SCP's front cover and 
held in place until activity ceases, then discard the magazine in question and 
replace it with another paper from the box outside SCP-1326's cell. Should the 
SCP release SCP-1326-2 due to failure to perform aforementioned procedure, 
SCP-1326's containment cell is to be kept on lockdown until all instances return 
to SCP-1326, at which point lockdown may be lifted and the magazine absorbed 
during the event must be replaced ASAP. All readings of SCP-1326 contents must 
be performed by D-class only, and any content deemed safe and/or useful to the 
Foundation is to be transcribed and stored on a Foundation computer under 
Document 1326-82. 

Description: SCP-1326 is an ornate leather-bound hardcover book adorned with 
various moving parts on its front cover, including a circular numbered dial in 
its upper-left corner, a semicircular dial in the lower-left corner, and several 
jointed mechanical arms crossing over its center, ending in mechanical claws or 
circular lenses. SCP-1326 is secured by a lock on its right side, designed to 
fit a small key designated SCP-1326-1. 

SCP-1326 may only be opened by SCP-1326-1; attempts to open the lock using picks 
or replicas of SCP-1326-1 have failed. 

The content of SCP-1326 appears to be an encyclopedic collection of various 
works and articles on diverse topics. The nature of these entries varies between 
known works by known authors, altered versions of known works, or unidentified 
works covering known or unknown material, some of which may be related to SCP's 
under or out of Foundation custody. The content yielded by SCP-1326 when opened 
may be changed by inputting "index numbers" via the dials on the book's front 
cover. These numbers do not appear to follow any sort of classification system, 
as no correlation has been found between the index values and the contents they 
yield.  

If SCP-1326 is brought within one meter of another book or written document, the 
arms on its cover will begin moving of their own accord in order to line up the 
lenses on the ends of these arms with the document in question. Once aligned, 
the lenses will emit a blue light and "scan" the document for approximately 5 
seconds, then return to their original positions. Testing has confirmed that 
this behavior is a means for the SCP to acquire new information, which will be 
presented in readable format under an apparently random index designation. How 
SCP-1326 is capable of identifying sources of information is unknown, though 
staff theorize it may possess a certain degree of sentience. It is also possible 
that the book simply reacts to repeating symbols or patterns, as it has been 
observed scanning Foundation staff nametags or groups of ceiling tiles, though 
such scans have been noted to be shorter than scans performed on complete books 
or written papers. 

It is advised to provide SCP-1326 with new material on a monthly basis, as the 
object will become hostile if not "fed" regularly. See Incident Report 1326-█ 
for details. 


Incident Report 1326-█ 

Remains of SCP-1326-2 killed during Incident 1326-█. Entity rapidly decayed to 
skeletal form after being killed by Dr. R█████ via blunt trauma. 

Incident Report 1326-█: On ██/██/██, after 30 days without 
"feeding" SCP-1326 opened of its own accord and released a swarm of entities 
resembling large arachnids, henceforth SCP-1326-2. These beings acted as an 
organized unit and proceeded to gather all objects relevant to data storage 
within the containment chamber, including loose documents, computers, and file 
cabinets, and bring them to SCP-1326, where they were [DATA EXPUNGED] and 
absorbed into the book. As the chamber was not locked at the time, SCP-1326-2 
proceeded to breach containment and continue this process with the surrounding 
offices, resulting in the loss of █ Foundation computers as well as Dr. 
R█████, who had been [DATA EXPUNGED] into SCP-1326 after attempting to 
destroy several instances of SCP-1326-2. After several minutes of activity, all 
instances of 1326-2 returned to SCP-1326's containment chamber, at which point 
the latter opened automatically, revealing a dark corridor extending past the 
thickness of the book. Once all 1326-2 had re-entered the book through this 
passageway, the latter closed and locked of its own accord. Ten minutes later, 
SCP-1326 reopened and expelled all items that had been stolen by 1326-2. All 
documents had been stripped of writing, and all computer hardware had been 
reverted to factory condition. The body of Dr. R█████ was not 
recovered following the incident. 


Addendum: Security footage of the SCP-1326-2 events reveal the entities make 
vocalizations resembling human speech while active. Most of these vocalizations 
are incoherent, but analysis reveals some instances are vocalizing in known 
languages. The following is a transcript of some vocalizations made by 1326-2, 
translated into English if not already spoken as such: 

You have failed to pay tribute. 

The Library does not accept unpaid tolls. 

Return your books on time. 

(heard during all 1326-2 events) 

Don't damage library property 

(heard while Dr. R█████ was under assault by SCP-1326-2) 

Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. 

(heard during a contained event after on-site staff had neglected to "feed" 
SCP-1326 on schedule. Of note is the fact that this vocalization was made in a 
voice nearly identical to that of Dr. R█████.) 



List of works found within SCP-1326

Document 1326-82

List of works found within SCP-1326, listed under their corresponding
index numbers. Index numbers are inputted by rotating the dials on
SCP-1326's cover to the desired values, pressing down on the dials
until they click to register the change in position, then inserting
SCP-1326-1 into its keyhole and unlocking SCP-1326. The circular and
hemispherical dials are numbered 1-360 and A-G, respectively, with
each combination of number and letter corresponding to different
content. Inserting multiple consecutive combinations of values has
been found to yield different results than those yielded by the
individual combinations, and inputted values will continue to "stack"
until SCP-1326 is opened. Due to the mass quantities of potential
combinations, this document is considered incomplete and will be
updated as new combinations are tested and their results recorded.

reconsider the containment procedures, with a response pending.


Index #: 360-F

Contents: How to do the coolest stunt and impress all of your
friends©, by John Fresh McKoolest

Notes: Several pages filled with complex instructions for a single

Contents: 2,000 Things You Should Never Write, by Johana Gregorio

Notes: Many pages filled with sentence and words from different known
and unknown languages enumerated in line from 1 to 2,000. Reading such
lines will cause no effect more than a faint dizziness in the subject,
although writing them will provoke reactions that go from sudden
decapitation to forgetting how to write at all. At the time of the
experiment, no word has affected any person other than the writer.
However, due to the dangerous nature of these words, Dr. █████████
joined Dr. █████████ request to reconsider the containment procedures
of SCP-1326. Response is still pending.

Translation has numerous errors.


Index #: 1-A repeated 76,000 times via robotic arm.

Contents: Letrainia, Author Unknown

Notes: A book documenting prophets Jesus Christ meeting Muhammad
██████ and discussing theology while scaling a mountain. While no
reason for their climb is established it is implied that they met by
coincidence despite historically living at different times. The

cities that get stranger the higher up they are until they are
seemingly random structures inhabited by primates. At the peak both
men find a a small wooden shack containing a single chair looking out
the window.
