state as a canceled project (see below.) The status, contents, and description 
of the episode vary per affected individual. 

According to a Foundation web scan of all internet platforms, the release status 
of SCP-5019 has been remembered in the following various ways: 

The episode had an official television release, but no saved copy exists. 
Rather, only official statements and plot summaries confirming its release. The 
consensus among those displaying this effect is that it is considered "lost 
media". 

The episode can be found in the same manner as the rest of the series.

The episode was planned for release, but was canceled with only a title and 
number released. This is the status remembered by non-affected individuals, and 
is the factually true status. 

The episode is a horror story written by a user of an online forum that is 
popularly mistaken for a lost episode. 

The episode is a horror story written by a user of an online forum that is 
remembered as such, and is not mistaken for being official content.

The episode is rumored to exist, but is confirmed fake by an individual who 
worked on the show. 

The episode does not exist in any form, not even in its true form as a canceled 
title. 
 

As concluded by Foundation-run tests and interviews, those affected by SCP-5019 
will view all discussion related to SCP-5019 as matching their own recollection, 
despite evidence to the contrary. This effect also applies to any stills or 
clips of SCP-5019.

@hufflenufflerufflepuffle Oh yeah! I know that 
episode. It's so wild that it's considered lost now, I 
remember watching it premiere as a kid. I think it 
was kind controversial because they alluded to
Lily having some sort of illness or disease.
Parents complained, and it it was pulled. But I 
mean the episode was rather harmless. It was just 
her being sick and chilling with her pet lamb Dizzy 
as her friends and family came by trying to cheer 
her up.

I think the line was like "I'm always sick, people 
just don't pay attention until I fall over." But that 
was it for anything off putting about it. I'm pretty 
sure clips exist on line, I have a few picture I'll 
upload that I found from it.

Makes sense

Non-existence confirmed makes so much sense. I thought it was real for the 
longest time, and dude, it scared the shit out of me. I mean I heard stuff about 
Lilly kicking her lamb into the street, and there were pictures of the scene. So 
fuckin glad those are fake and fanmade. Ick Day, the episode where Lilly went of 
being mean and grumpy to her friends around time because she was sick and 
refused medicine. I'd have nightmares about that when I was little. It's a show 
for like 5 to 9 year olds! God I hate the internet lmao

Thought I'd drop what I remember of the Loopy Lilly episode peeps have been 
discussing. Basically Lilly is out in the town with her friends and someone near 
them gets sick and then they're scared that they'll get sick. The spend the 
whole episode being super careful afraid that they'll get germs and stuff. At 
the end they all get sick. The episode was controversial because parents were 
afraid it sent a kinda mean message. It's weird that it's lost. Now I don't 
remember much either, that's about it.

OH MY ACTUAL FUCKING GOD WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?? Like am I crazy?? I'm 
the creator of the damn thing, look me up. The episode isn't an online horror 
tale! It's a real thing that I wrote and helped animate, and damnit the plot is 
NOTHING like that. Dizzy isn't hit by a car what the fuck 


[–] Daisiesinrazors [S] 10 points 15 hours ago

Ikr! pretty crazy that someone would write something like that based off a show 
for literal children. Honestly, I heard the crew of the show is pretty upset by 
it. I hate the internet lmao 


[–] Nichola.myersss 1 point 7 hours ago

First off, I didn't say anything even close to that! Jesus christ! What, they 
paying you or something? Why is the whole internet broken?

being dumb as fuck with this

Nichola.Myersss  15 October 2015

It's my episode I made it


Cate @Lovealemeats09  16 October 2015

Yeah guys. The episode was never 
made. Just listen to the creator and 
stop being edgy. It was never supposed 
to exist, it doesn't exist, and it's never 
going to. 


Nichola.Myersss  16 October 2015

@Lovealemeats09 first off not what I 
said. It does exist! I've got a hard drive 
of the damn thing!


Nichola.Myersss  16 October 2015

@Lovealemeats09 I have several 
pictures of it that I could upload!

I really should have seen this shit 
coming

Nichola.Myersss  21 October 2015

It's not like it's the first time this has 
happened


Nichola.Myersss  21 October 2015

How hard is this? Little girl is sick and
no one sees that she's always sick and 
they just think everything is fine and 
they never listen to her because they're 
too entitled up in themselves and shit


Nichola.Myersss  21 October 2015

Little girl wants to be more than her 
illness and problems that everyone is 
convinced is fine


Nichola.Myersss  21 October 2015

Every time girl tries to speak up, girl is 
censored


Nichola.Myersss  21 October 2015

She's tried so many different ways but 
it's always deleted and brushed off 
because people never listen to me 
because the world is filled with 
censorship


Nichola.Myersss  21 October 2015

Especially over things that matter 
because I forgot, it's always about them 
and what they want to see


Nichola.Myersss  21 October 2015

No one listens. They only see what they 
want to in the ways that they see it because 
stopping to listen to someone else like 
oh no god forbid


Nichola.Myersss  21 October 2015

why do I even try, it's not like this is 
going to work either

 
PoI-5019 has not been active on any online source since 10-23-2015. Foundation 
web crawlers have been coded to alert the SCP-5019 Head Researcher immediately 
should PoI-5019 become active once more. 


Addendum-2:

On 12-04-17, Agent Carawoa discovered the root of SCP-5019's anomalous features 
stem from PoI-6786, whom she knows through a Foundation undercover operation she 
is currently involved in. 

Agent Carawoa reports that PoI-6786 was a member of the production cast for 
Loopy Lilly, and was upset that PoI-5019 was given the production lead role of 
the series finale instead of her. PoI-6786 expressed disinterest in PoI-5019's 
finished product, believing that the message she was trying to spread was 
inappropriate for a program of a light-hearted nature. PoI-6786 admitted 
creating a finished clip for the episode, and to implementing it as a part of 
PoI-5019's work. PoI-5019 submitted the clip to her boss, and SCP-5019 suddenly 
manifested. PoI-6786 is unaware as to how her messing with the episode spread 
such an effect, but holds clear guilt as she explained the situation to fellow 
members of her artists' cabal. 

Agent Carawoa was able to retrieve stills from the completed clip PoI-6786 
created. The following are currently under Foundation investigation.
