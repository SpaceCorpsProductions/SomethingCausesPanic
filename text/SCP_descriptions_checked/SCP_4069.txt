DRAFT LISTING | EYES ONLY | DO NOT COPY
THIS ARTICLE HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROVED FOR PUBLISHING BY INTSCPFN AUTHORITIES.

This article has been posted to IntSCPFN listings from an unapproved location 
under special exemption circumstances. This article may contain factual 
inaccuracies and illegitimate documentation. If you understand the above and 
wish to proceed, you may do so below. 

Item #: SCP-4069

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4069 appears to be self-contained with no 
maintenance requirements. As there is no known exit to SCP-4069, it is assumed 
that no physical contact between SCP-4069 and the outside world can occur under 
current circumstances. Personnel screening this first rendition of this article 
should take caution to ensure no anomalous textual hazards/infohazards are 
present without the author's knowledge. 

Although threats can be present in SCP-4069-A, damage done to the affected 
person is not permanent. 

Description: SCP-4069 is a four-walled room measuring 5 by 8 meters with a 
3-meter ceiling. SCP-4069 appears to exist as a self-contained extradimensional 
location. The construction of and materials in this room are consistent with 
those of a modern Foundation facility. 

SCP-4069 is unlit, but has functioning electricity. SCP-4069 is furnished with 
one cubicle, equipped with one desktop computer and one webcam. This computer 
can be used normally, and appears to display a live connection to IntSCPFN via a 
wired Ethernet connection. However, as no outside observers are capable of 
confirming this, it is considered possible that the network connection is not 
legitimate. 

Centered in the room is a table equipped with one 30-meter tape measure, one 
flashlight, one padlock with two working keys, a calculator, several 
miscellaneous papers and writing utensils, and one standard-issue Foundation 
security officer uniform. 

SCP-4069 has one door, which can be opened through the use of a standard-issue 
Level 4 access card.1 Behind this door is an additional extradimensional area, 
designated SCP-4069-A, containing an uncorrelated variety of environments and 
hazards. For details, see addenda. 

A humanoid entity, SCP-4069-B, occasionally emerges from SCP-4069-A. SCP-4069-B 
appears to be an adult male of indeterminate ethnicity whose eyes are obscured 
by a black bar as if redacted in a photograph. This entity has only worn the 
same black and white three-piece suit in all manifestations to date. SCP-4069-B 
is occasionally hostile. 


Addendum I: Exploration Logs

Test #: 1

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 enters SCP-4069-A and emerges behind a tree in a dense forest, clad in 
green combat gear and running alongside several other men dressed similarly. 
C-51174 notes that he and his peers are each holding an Ithaca M372 which he 
estimates is one of the models produced from 1937-1941. Behind the group of men, 
a large reptilian creature is snaking through the trees, striking individuals 
with its tail and lacerating their throats. C-51174 leaps over a small ditch, is 
struck in the head by the creature, and immediately reawakens sitting in 
SCP-4069's cubicle. Exploration concluded. 


Test #: 2

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 opens the door using his Level 4 access card and proceeds. The door 
shuts behind him. C-51174 turns on his flashlight. C-51174 proceeds down a gray 
concrete tunnel for 34 paces. C-51174 turns left at an intersection of tunnels 
and proceeds for 120 paces until a dead end is reached. Upon turning around, 
C-51174 is faced with the backside of the door again. C-51174 scans his access 
card and returns to SCP-4069. Exploration concluded. 


Test #: 3

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 opens the door to find an unknown flesh-like material has grown within 
inches of the doorway, completely filling it, and is secreting a foul-smelling 
and seemingly corrosive fluid. C-51174 closes the door. Test concluded. 


Test #: 4

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 opens the door and steps through into a coastal deciduous forest. The 
doorway has disappeared by the third time he looks back at it. C-51174 proceeds 
along a coastline for seventeen minutes on foot before encountering a 
barbed-wire fence. A sign on the fence reads "PROPERTY OF SCPF: NO TRESPASSING" 
in large letters. C-51174 crawls under the fence and continues in the same 
direction for 3 minutes before a building becomes visible. 

As C-51174 approaches the building, two site security personnel approach him and 
question him. The two guards then handcuff him and motion for him to get on his 
knees. C-51174 complies. 

Unknown Personnel 1: Identify yourself.

C-51174: C-51174, Level 4 field operative.

Unknown Personnel 1: Does the black moon howl?

C-51174: No.

C-51174 is struck on the side of the head with a baton.

Unknown Personnel 2: Are you really in there, Agent?

Unknown Personnel 1: He's very far gone.

C-51174: Only when waning.

C-51174 is struck in the head again and loses his vision. He regains awareness 
an indeterminate amount of time later, on the floor beside the door in SCP-4069. 
Test concluded. 


Test #: 5

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 enters SCP-4069-A, which is a small security room with an array of 
monitors displaying graphically violent, thematically similar footage of 
contemporary Foundation operations and incidents from C-51174's personal life. 
C-51174 observes the footage for several minutes before turning around to exit 
through the open door. Test concluded. 


Test #: 6

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 attempts to open the door with his access card. The door lock displays 
yellow and does not disengage. He knocks three times and the door opens to an 
expanse of upper atmosphere. A pressure vacuum immediately pulls C-51174 out of 
the doorway, along with most loose materials from inside the room. C-51174 falls 
for two minutes before losing consciousness, and then reawakens seated in the 
cubicle chair. Test concluded. 

Note: The materials present on the table in SCP-4069 were neatly arranged 
despite having been removed from the room by the pressure vacuum previously. 


Test #: 7

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 opens the door and enters a glass-walled chamber. On the other side of 
the glass are several Foundation researchers watching his movements. The door 
closes behind him as he approaches the adjacent pane of glass and attempts to 
communicate with one of the personnel watching. She does not appear to see him, 
and is instead focused on a point in space slightly to the left of and behind 
him. A scraping sound is heard on the floor, and a force knocks him to the 
ground. His vision fails when his head strikes the concrete, and he reawakens in 
the cubicle. Test concluded. 


Test #: 8

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 opens the door. SCP-4069-B steps out of SCP-4069-A.

C-51174: Who are you?

SCP-4069-B does not answer, and instead leans against the cubicle wall, watching 
C-51174. Any further questions are ignored. SCP-4069-B remains in this position 
until C-51174 begins the next test. 


Test #: 9

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 opens the door to find a large mirror. His reflection displays his 
uniform and equipment, but not his body itself. He inspects the reflection for 
several minutes before closing the door. Test concluded. 

Note: C-51174's body is visibly normal in video footage recorded on the cubicle 
webcam. 


Test #: 10

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 opens the door and SCP-4069-B emerges again.

SCP-4069-B: What is your designation?

C-51174: My Foundation designation?

SCP-4069-B: Do you know who you are?

C-51174: Who are you? Where am I and how did I end up here? How do I get out?

SCP-4069-B: Everything you need is contained in this room.

SCP-4069-B closes the distance between itself and C-51174 and reaches for his 
throat. C-51174 loses awareness as soon as physical contact is made, and 
reawakens sitting in the cubicle, with SCP-4069-B not present. Test concluded. 


Test #: 11

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 enters SCP-4069-A and emerges in an underlit hallway, holding a CZ-753 
and clad in an unrecognizable black uniform. C-51174 crouches and slowly 
approaches a glass-walled room in which several men are seated around a 
conference table and discussing a satellite image of Moscow displayed on a large 
monitor. A timestamp on the feed reveals that it is February 3rd, 1987. The logo 
of the Central Intelligence Agency is emblazoned on the glass beside the 
entrance. C-51174 draws his pistol and fires once into the chest of the man 
leading the meeting. C-51174 notes that, as with approximately half of 
SCP-4069-A explorations, he is not able to control his movements and actions. 
Two of the other men seated at the table draw their sidearms and fire at C-51174 
as he lunges out of the doorway and the bullets ricochet off the glass. C-51174 
rounds the next corner and is struck in the head with a truncheon by a CIA 
officer, immediately losing consciousness. C-51174 awakens in the cubicle chair. 
Exploration concluded. 


Test #: 12

Subject: C-51174

Events Transcribed:

C-51174 enters SCP-4069-A and emerges onto the deck of a small aircraft carrier 
at night during a thunderstorm. He notes that he is wearing the dress blue 
uniform of a US Navy Lieutenant Junior Grade. Based upon context and clothing 
style, he estimates that the year is between 1940 and 1945. He intercepts 
another man and pulls him aside. 

C-51174: Does the black moon howl?

Unknown Master Chief Petty Officer: Only when waning.

C-51174: What are our readings? Does the Captain know yet?

MCPO: The Regional Director won't allow me to inform the Captain yet.

A loud screeching sound is heard. C-51174 and the MCPO immediately duck under an 
overhang as a loudly crackling visual anomaly in the form of a toroid of yellow 
electricity manifests several meters above the surface of the deck. 

C-51174: We needed time to warn them.

A flash of light is seen. C-51174 opens his eyes to find he is in the cubicle 
chair in SCP-4069. Exploration concluded. 


Addendum II: Author's Statement

I, the author (C-51174) have been documenting this anomaly for approximately 3 
weeks by recording the results of entering SCP-4069-A. I do not know if I am the 
only individual who has witnessed the existence of SCP-4069. I am aware of the 
possibility that SCP-4069 is nonexistent and simply the result of my own 
perceptions (such as being under the effect of a memory-altering cognitohazard) 
but the need for investigation stands either way. 

The SCP Foundation database appears to be the only way I can communicate with or 
access the outside world, but my account was deactivated upon first 
investigation and I did not think to bypass posting restrictions in the manner I 
did until recently. Please investigate this and contact me if possible. There 
does not appear to be a way out of here and I arrived here by means of waking up 
nude under the table with only the memory of getting out of bed at Site-42 that4 
morning. I put on the clothes I found and managed as best I could but this is 
becoming more and more distressing. Please send help. 

Of note is that I do not require food or water while in SCP-4069, my body does 
not perform basic, constant functions such as salivating, and I cannot feel a 
pulse on my wrist or neck.

SCP-4069

Most Recent Edit 09/08/41 22:03

Item #: SCP-4069

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: As SCP-4069 has been shown to affect
all types of Foundation personnel across a wide range of departments,
containment efforts for SCP-4069 are to be directed toward the
education of all personnel on the possibility that they will encounter
the anomaly. Personnel are encouraged to opt into installation of a
Personnel Identification Implant1 due to the fact that SCP-4069's
influence is temporary if the identity of the individual in question
is translated into ED-K++2 and the resulting copy reactivated in a
different body.

Personnel permanently deceased in baseline reality but present in
SCP-4069 are to remain on employee rosters under the E/4069 E-class
personnel category. Personnel only temporarily present in SCP-4069 are
designated Provisional E-class and referred to as PE/4069 personnel,
but are included under the E/4069 designation for the sake of brevity
in documentation. PE/4069 personnel should be interviewed in text
regarding their preferences on the application of their identity's
copy before they are removed from SCP-4069 via the activation of said
copy.

In order to ensure E/4069 personnel are capable of communicating with
personnel in baseline reality, MTF Lambda-4K ("Feedback Process") is
tasked with manually reactivating the IntSCPFN3 accounts of deceased
personnel and determining if the user is present in SCP-4069. If no
response from a given account is noted after 72 hours, the account
must be deactivated again in order to maintain up-to-date network
activity reports and ensure security. MTF Lambda-4K members are
instructed to communicate with E/4069 personnel and modify this
document with notable information if necessary.

E/4069-class personnel are advised not to disclose their status to
other employees on IntSCPFN unless asked to do so by their
supervisors. E/4069 personnel are encouraged to report on their
experiences by means of using IntSCPFN's private messaging system or
real-time chat system to contact MTF Lambda-4K members. E/4069
personnel are not required to enter SCP-4069-A at any point if they do
not wish to do so.

Description: SCP-4069 is an extrauniversal location resembling an
office in a Foundation site, accessible only by Foundation employees
following their death. The main section of SCP-4069 is a four-walled
room measuring 5 by 8 meters with a 3-meter ceiling. Centered in the
room is a table equipped with one 30-meter tape measure, one
flashlight, one padlock with two working keys, a calculator, several
miscellaneous papers and writing utensils, one clearance level card
matching the rank of the affected individual, and one Foundation
uniform of varying department. SCP-4069 is furnished with one cubicle,
equipped with one desktop computer and one chair, as well as a webcam.
This computer can be used normally, and displays a live connection to
IntSCPFN via a wired Ethernet connection. Access to IntSCPFN from the
desktop computer in SCP-4069 is legitimate and activity is reflected
in baseline reality.

SCP-4069 can only be accessed via direct manifestation inside the
anomaly or via communication with personnel already within the
anomaly. Personnel can only directly manifest in SCP-4069 if they are
deceased in baseline reality, and SCP-4069 is not accessible from
baseline reality by any means other than this. Activating a duplicate
copy of an individual's identity, such as via ED-K++ translation from
a Personnel Identification Implant and inception of the file in a new
human subject, will remove the individual from SCP-4069.

Upon manifesting in SCP-4069, the affected person will not remember
the 4-7 hours before or including their death. To date, all 46
documented E/4069 personnel have reported that that they do not
require food and water, no longer perform other basic bodily
functions, and initially manifest nude but find a uniform and
undergarments in their size on the table.4 Personnel in SCP-4069
respond to any physical pain or perceived threat encountered in
SCP-4069-A by losing awareness immediately and later regaining it
while seated at the room's desktop computer.

SCP-4069 exists as an independent iteration of itself for each person
experiencing it; although multiple personnel are now present in
SCP-4069, they are not able to perceive nor physically interact with
each other. Personnel in SCP-4069 are capable of communicating with
personnel in baseline reality by using their assigned IntSCPFN
accounts to interact with the Foundation database as they would
normally; however, as policy requires an IntSCPFN account be
deactivated upon confirmation of the user's death, these accounts must
be manually reactivated by IntSCPFN management.

SCP-4069 has one door, which can be opened through the use of a
standard-issue access card of any clearance level; this door will open
to an extradimensional area, designated SCP-4069-A. In 72% of cases,
entering SCP-4069-A will result in the subject experiencing a
replication of a different deceased Foundation employee's death and/or
the circumstances leading up to but not including their death.
Although the time period of an experience is typically indiscernible
based on surroundings, the earliest year observed out of 46 cases and
280 individual tests is 1901.

A humanoid entity, SCP-4069-B, is sometimes present in SCP-4069.
SCP-4069-B is described by observers as a human of varying height,
race, and gender whose eyes are obscured by a black bar as if redacted
in a photograph. This individual is always reported as wearing a black
and white three-piece suit. SCP-4069-B will sometimes comment on the
subject's actions, and has been directly hostile in 12 documented
accounts. However, SCP-4069-B will generally not interact with the
subject if present, and will instead observe them from a short
distance.

Due to the fact that E/4069 personnel are not aware that they are
deceased unless informed and most of these personnel are not aware
that SCP-4069 has an SCP designation, not all E/4069 personnel are
capable of communicating their status to personnel in baseline
reality. Thus, it is not known if SCP-4069 affects all deceased
Foundation personnel or only a certain percentage of personnel. E/4069
personnel reading this document should search for "MTF Lambda-4K" in
IntSCPFN employee directories and contact one or more members for
further information.

History: On July 28, 2041, the SCP-4069 slot was taken in the IntSCPFN
database by C-511745 via his then-deactivated account. C-51174 had
been killed in action by a hostile anomalous entity at 5:20 PM on July
4. The slot was used to host two PNG files in which he visually
confirmed his identity and asked for assistance via use of the camera
in SCP-4069's cubicle. When his account was reactivated and permitted
text-editing capabilities, he uploaded his own documentation for
SCP-4069 in order to inform other Foundation personnel of the
situation at hand. Some of his original text remains in use in this
rendition of the document.

It is unknown if C-51174 is the first Foundation employee to encounter
SCP-4069 or simply the first to document it. Due to the convoluted
manner in which C-51174 evaded IntSCPFN's page security permissions to
notify database administrators of his account status and activity, it
is considered likely that other personnel had experienced SCP-4069
previously but were not able to alert personnel in baseline reality of
their status. As of September 7, 2041, C-51174 is no longer present in
SCP-4069.


Addendum I: Active O5 Council Assessment

In summary, SCP-4069 is a reminder of one of the many reasons the
Foundation strives to make the advancements that it does.

Knowledge of the existence of SCP-4069 is a threat to personnel
well-being, certainly, but the potential of manifesting in SCP-4069
following death is a threat to only one iteration of any given
employee's consciousness. With the development of the Personnel
Identification Implant and the subsequent development of the capacity
to translate an individual's self — the memories, the personality, the
beliefs, minus only the body — into ED-K++ and save it as a text file
like any other piece of information, our perspective has shifted.

The Council recognizes the concerns brought to light by some personnel
and voiced by the Ethics Committee regarding the morality of
duplicating the consciousness of a human being. If an artificial
duplicate of a person's consciousness — whether inhabiting a human
body or not — is capable of suffering in the same way that the
original was, it is assumedly unethical to allow harm to come to it.
Thus, to avoid the existence of extraneous duplicates, the Council
requires that only one duplicate of an employee's consciousness be
present in Foundation files at any given time, and always overridden
with the most recent saved version of their script. With the discovery
of SCP-4069, we have better reasons than we ever did previously to
encourage PII installation.

Judging by the accounts we have read, SCP-4069 appears to its
inhabitants to be a sort of purgatory, and several of the permanent
E/4069 personnel believe that it is designed as such by some deity or
other. The questions of how SCP-4069 came into existence and what it
signifies are irrelevant; SCP-4069 may be a permanent place for those
without a PII, but it is temporary with the implementation of the
PII's transfer capabilities. We recommend that all personnel undergo
PII installation as soon as is possible; Foundation employment does
not end and has never ended after death, and SCP-4069 is simply
another obstacle soon to be rendered obsolete by the advancement of
technology.


Footnotes

1. On June 10, 2035, the option to have a Personnel Identification
Implant (PII) installed was opened across the board for all personnel,
thus allowing an employee's consciousness, memories, and awareness to
be saved as a script written in ED-K++ and then installed in a
different human subject following the death of the employee; this is
the most effective containment method for ensuring personnel are only
temporarily affected should they encounter SCP-4069.

2. A coding language designed for use in Foundation-modified Schulman
devices and later used in the Personnel Identification Implant.
