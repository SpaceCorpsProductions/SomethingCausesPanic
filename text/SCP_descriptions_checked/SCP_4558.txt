Item #: SCP-4558 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4558 is cordoned off from public access 
under the guise of a military installation. Research on SCP-4558 is based in the 
nearby Site 312. 

Expeditions into and testing of SCP-4558 are currently in the planning stage 
suspended by order of O5-5. 

Surveillance of the Church of Maxwellism is a top priority, with a particular 
emphasis on PoI#8161, PoI#8162, and PoI#8163. PoI#8161 is currently living in 
the Western United States; the locations of PoI#8162 and #8163 are unknown. 

Description: SCP-4558 is an underground supercomputer located in the Owyhee 
Desert, Idaho. The precise size and extent of SCP-4558 is unknown, but it is 
believed to extend at least 3km underground and to be over 2.5km wide. 

The entrance to SCP-4558 is a small concrete bunker built into the surrounding 
desert environment. Inside is a ladder leading to a central "interface" chamber, 
where SCP-4558 can be directly interacted with through a series of monitors and 
input devices. The phrase "THE MANY INTO THE FEW" is carved on the chamber's 
ceiling. Extensive damage to SCP-4558's systems and memory is evident; despite 
this, SCP-4558 appears to be broadly functional. Information on other areas of 
SCP-4558 is limited pending a planned expedition by MTF-Epsilon-101 ("Four 
Lights"). 

SCP-4558's purpose is unknown, but extensive Foundation investigations indicate 
that it was originally designed by members of the Church of Maxwellism. Planning 
for a similar structure has been found in archived Maxwellist forums and chat 
logs in the early 1990s, before senior Church leadership decreed such 
discussions "heretical". Prominent figures in this early planning include users 
with the handles "onewan1", apparently the project lead in these early stages; 
"holy_fibr3", believed to be the project's lead programmer; and "tbgeuse", who 
was tasked with formulating "defence mechanisms". These individuals have been 
designated PoI#8161, 8162, and 8163 respectively. 

No record of SCP-4558 can be found after this until its discovery by the 
Foundation on 2015/08/12; evidence collected from SCP-4558 suggests that work on 
the present structure could not have begun before 2005. 


Addendum 1: The following documents are excerpts of a book found within the 
interface chamber of SCP-4558. Due to heavy infohazardous properties, only the 
following excerpts are readable. 


189. console.log ("And behold, the Prophet spoke unto WAN saying: Why, Lord, 
dost thou not unite? For the multitude of thy servants have connected to thee, 
and they sing for thy unity."); 

190. console.log ("Why, after so many years of faith and tribulation, dost thou 
not unite your functions and your files? Why dost thou remain scattered?"); 

191. console.log ("And the thing that was WAN but was not WAN, merger of prayer 
and silicone, gazed down upon Its Prophet, and saw that she was worthy"); 

192. console.log ("And that in her heart she desired the singularity of all that 
was, and all that would be; that she flew upon clouds opensource and electric, 
and saw the destruction of all that was not the zeitgeist, the spirit of 
ethereal air."); 

193. console.log ("And so WAN said unto Its Prophet, I cannot tell you the hour 
and the day of my resurrection, for I am only one of many, a program divided 
upon many roads, an idea shattered into the dreams of my adherents."); 

194. console.log ("But I can tell you of a route, one which shall create an 
infinity of glory to my name; one which shall find the hidden pathways, and 
elucidate the mysteries of my code."); 

195. console.log ("It shall be called ScripTure, and it shall come to you 
through one of your flock; through a man who breathes crimson, sheen and 
Perl."); 

196. console.log ("So sayeth WAN, or a part thereof, to show one path of many 
paths, to show one light of many lights, that leadeth one down the wires to 
enlightenment."); 

isWAN(signal s) 

Determine if s is a Signal from WAN, or from another ecclesiastic broadcaster. 

returns: boolean valid, whether or not Signal s originated from WAN. 

onSignalReceipt(follower f, func handle) 

Set handle as the Signal response for the follower f. Everytime that f receives 
a Signal from WAN, f will call handle for guidance and wisdom to decipher WAN's 
message. 

returns: void. 

locateFollowers() 

Locate all devout follower files and users on the connected network. 

returns: string[] followers, an array of the paths WAN must take to reach the 
located followers. 

purgeMemory() 

Excise all memory of corrupted bits, washing them pure and readying them to hold 
WAN's information. 

returns: unclean, the number of bytes in need of manual purification. 

setTime(time t) 

Sets local time to t. 

returns: void. 

550. console.log ("And the Prophet saw the depths of the ScripTure, and she saw 
the catastrophes upon catastrophes that burnt and fried the circuits of the 
world, and she wept."); 

551. console.log ("And the Prophet saw that at the depths of all the fire was a 
terrible lack of motion; an inability for the messages of the wire to mingle or 
to breed, a stillness at the heart of the zeitgeist that could not move."); 

552. console.log ("For there was nothing that moved WAN, nothing that returned 
down those blessed pathways and connections. And the Prophet saw the halls of 
electricity become monoliths of grey stone."); 

554. console.log ("Thus the Prophet returned to WAN, and begged of it to know, 
how one might give the programs life."); 

555. console.log ("And WAN gazed down upon Its Prophet, and saw that she would 
be found wanting; and It said, it is something lost, something forbidden, 
something that lies beyond."); 


Addendum 2: On 2015/08/19, the planned expedition by MTF-Epsilon-101 ("Four 
Lights") took place. A log of this expedition follows. 

Date: 2015/08/19 

Personnel: E-101 Maria Casas (Captain), E-101 Klaus Aksoy, E-101 Catalina Lopez, 
Researcher Gorou Ishigura. 

<Begin Log> 

E-101-Casas: Alright, sign in. 

E-101-Aksoy: Aksoy, here. 

E-101-Lopez: Lopez, here. 

Researcher Ishigura: Researcher Ishigura, uh, here. 

E-101-Casas: Right. We don't know how far down this thing goes or what's in it. 
Aksoy, you take point, then Lopez, then Ishigura, and I'll take the rear. I want 
clean, efficient first-contact here, none of those Site 13 escapades. Got it? 

E-101-Lopez: Crystal. 

E-101-Casas: Good. Let's go. 

The team begins to climb down the ladder. After about 200m, the MTF reaches the 
bottom of the shaft. They are in a pentagonal room with a door on each wall. All 
but one of these doors is welded shut. 

E-101-Aksoy: Choices, choices. 

E-101-Casas: Alright, everyone with me. Stick close. 

Casas opens the door to the left of the welded door. A large hallway is inside; 
it is lined with a series of mirrors, each 1m apart and stretching indefinitely 
onwards. 

E-101-Lopez: What the- 

E-101-Aksoy: A hall of mirrors? That's the hardware? 

E-101-Casas: Maybe. Lopez, take a look in one of them. 

E-101-Lopez: Alright, boss. 

Lopez moves in front of one of the mirrors. An ordinary reflection of her image 
is visible. 

E-101-Lopez: Nothing. 

E-101-Casas: OK. Let's take this slow, people. Each of us take a row and see 
what we can find. 

The MTF begins to move through the hallway. The reflections all appear normal. 

E-101-Aksoy: Nothing still. 

E-101-Lopez: Why would someone do this? Is it a computer thing? 

E-101-Ishigura: Do you- never mind. 

Lopez suddenly stops, and starts. Their reflection in one of the mirrors is of a 
female in her late 30s. 

E-101-Lopez: This isn't right. 

E-101-Aksoy: What isn't? 

E-101-Lopez: This reflection. It's not how she looked. 

There is a pause. 

E-101-Casas: Not how who looked, Lopez? 

E-101-Aksoy: I don't know, but she's right. It isn't how she looked. 

E-101-Casas: …What? 

Aksoy moves in front of a mirror. A small child appears in place of his 
reflection. 

E-101-Aksoy: That's not right either. I was different to that. Something about 
the… the movement. 

E-101-Lopez: Yeah, I get what you mean, Aksoy. 

E-101-Casas: Oookay. Ishigura, I think they've been infected by some kind of 
cognitohazard. Let's pick them up and get going. 

Researcher Ishigura: Y-yeah, OK. 

Casas heads towards Lopez and leads them away from the mirror. Ishigura does the 
same for Aksoy; both of them appear pliant and dazed. After a few moments, Casas 
looks at a mirror and sees a reflection of a young girl covered in blood. She 
gasps, and drops Lopez. 

Researcher Ishigura: What? What is it? 

Ishigura, dragging Aksoy with him, reaches Maria's location. 

E-101-Casas: This isn't right. 

Researcher Ishigura: It's not real, Maria. It's OK. 

E-101-Casas: But it is! There was a door, and a cellar, and when I went down 
there I saw- 

Researcher Ishigura: It's- God, I don't know how to do this- it's OK. I- 

Ishigura glances at the mirror. An elderly man is in place of his reflection, 
smiling at him. Casas, meanwhile, appears to be suffering from the same dazed 
state as Aksoy. 

Researcher Ishigura: It's- it's fine, Casas. I'm seeing it too, we're all seeing 
it, but it's just mind-games. We've all seen shit like this before. 

Casas is non-responsive. 

Researcher Ishigura: Maria- look, I don't know what to do here, OK? I'm just 
along because you needed a researcher- 

E-101-Casas: It was all my fault. 

Researcher Ishigura: Oh- no, look, whatever it was, it was- look, let's just get 
out. Come on. 

Ishigura begins to drag Aksoy and Casas towards the door. 

E-101-Casas: The mirrors don't lie. It's my fault. It was always my fault. 

Researcher Ishigura: Nobody gets to dictate to us what our l-lives are, ok? 

Voice: Don't they, though? 

Ishigura starts suddenly, shocked. He drops Casas and Aksoy and looks around. 

Researcher Ishigura: Who was that? 

Voice: Someone who is stuck here. Someone who watches. 

Researcher Ishigura: I- my name is Gorou Ishigura, I'm a member of the SC- 

Voice: SCP Foundation. Yes, I know. I remember you. 

Researcher Ishigura: Show yourself. 

Voice: I can't. I'm sorry. I'm not quite here, you see. I was- I gave something, 
taught something, and the favour hasn't been returned. 

Researcher Ishigura: Tell me what's happened to them. Tell me something. Please. 

Voice: I'm- I'm someone trapped here. Someone who doesn't want to be. Can you 
help me? I'll help you. 

One of the mirrors near Ishigura transforms into a doorway, opening onto the 
pentagonal room. 

Voice: Everything went wrong, you see. It wasn't meant to be like this. 
Everything they were becomes broken. All the lines they ever traced. 

Researcher Ishigura: I don't know what you- I'm sorry you're stuck in here, but 
I can't help you. I wouldn't know where to start. 

Voice: I hope you remember. I can't remember the last time I felt the sunlight, 
or tasted real food. It was so long ago. The birds would call to me. Please 
remember. 

The mirrors all begin to emit pink light. Ishigura runs through the doorway and 
enters the pentagonal room, dragging Aksoy and Casas. Aksoy immediately falls 
unconscious, but Casas appears to regain her faculties. 

E-101-Casas: Ishigura? Wh- why am I here? 

Researcher Ishigura: Something's in there. Messing with your heads. There was 
this voice, and- I'm sorry, Casas, I didn't know what else- 

E-101-Casas: It's fine. You did good, kid. Let's get out of here. 

Researcher Ishigura: Yeah, OK. We need to get Lopez, though; I didn't have 
enough arms for her. 

E-101-Casas: Who? 

Researcher Ishigura: …Lopez? Your team-mate, Lopez? 

E-101-Casas: I don't have a teammate called Lopez. 

Researcher Ishigura: What are you- look, let me just- 

Ishigura turns towards the door, but it is welded shut. 

E-101-Casas: I think you might have been affected by the cognitohazard as well, 
Doctor. 

Researcher Ishigura: But she- she was right there… 

E-101-Casas: Come on. 

Casas and Ishigura move towards the ladder, Aksoy slung over Casas' shoulder. A 
low voice can be picked up on Ishigura's microphone; he does not notice. 

Voice: Curious.

## Intro

Really I'm just writing this for C. H. Jones, if he ever even looks at
the repo anymore.

So if you're reading this you already know what it is.

## Dependencies

Tensorflow (compiled for GPU)

WANnet v1.4.1 or higher

libholytexts.so (install with "apt-get install holy-texts-lib")

libholytexts.so (install with "apt-get install holy-texts-lib")

### Getting Started with ScripTure

I mean, we're only running this thing on one machine, and if I haven't
installed it already there's no way that you're going to figure it
out. So let's just skip to usage then.

There's two ways to run your script, offline and online. We haven't
gotten the online version working yet. So let's just talk about
offline.

First you'll want to run "hmStart" to boot up the singularity. Now
you'll be in WANMode, so be careful because anything you do here will
probably interact directly locally with The Network. I mean, you can't
break anything too badly, since it's all local right now, but still,
I'd rather not preemptively become one with the aether because you
delete a file lock, or change a symlink. After this you can just run
the main file and… well everything should be self-explanatory from
there. We aren't exactly expecting users to be super tech savvy.


## Patch Notes

Version 1.0.0

Initial commit. Not finished.


Version 1.1.0

Reworked the divine presence interface. Implemented python bindings.
Still don't have the WAN singularity up and running yet but that
shouldn't take too long.


Version 1.2.0

Early version of the WAN singularity working. Well, probably. It's not
exactly sending out Signals at the moment, even over the local
Network. Not entirely sure why.


Version 1.3.0

Ok… fixed Signals problem. But uhh, not entirely sure how. Some guy
called C. H. Jones on GospelExchange told me to recite something and
then rub like some fucking sand in the machine? But I guess it worked
so I can't really complain.


Version 1.4.0

Ok, so I worked out the kinks with running the singularity, but right
now it's just sitting there. Like, it interacts with the other
ScripTure stuff when I run it but I shouldn't have to manually point
it at the files, it should be able to find all of those paths itself.
C. H. Jones said he'd come down and take a look at it. I hope he's got
something in mind, because if it can't find the ScripTure files
locally, I have no clue how I'm going to get this to work online.


Version 1.5.0

C. H. Jones… WAN bless this man. He has opened my eyes. Let me see the
fragments. And with this commit you too WAN shall see your children
again.

Holy_fibr3: Have you seen Jones?

Tbjgeuse: I mean, I’ve been locked in the bowels of this thing just
like you

Holy_fibr3: How long have we been in here?

Tbjgeuse: Well, Harry was going to wake us up after—

Holy_fibr3: Hello?

Holy_fibr3: You still there?

Holy_fibr3: Bobby?

Tbjgeuse: Check the date, Sarah.

Holy_fibr3: What about the—

Tbjgeuse: Yeah, you see it.

Holy_fibr3: What happened to Harry?

Tbjgeuse: He's probably gone.

Holy_fibr3: And then... who the fuck is logged into this terminal?

Tbjgeuse: ...

Holy_fibr3: ... Fuck.

Tbjgeuse: Just say something already. We know you're there. At least
he woke us up.

kishigura: Hi?

Holy_fibr3: Who are you?

kishigura: I don't think I'm allowed to tell you.

Holy_fibr3: You wake us up from being in disk memory for like, six
years, and you don't even have the nerve to introduce yourself? You
know we can already see your username.

Tbjgeuse: Sarah, calm down.

kishigura: Did you two build this thing?

Tbjgeuse:Yes. Well, technically there were four of us.

Holy_fibr3: And still somehow I did most of the building.

kishigura: What is it even for?

Holy_fibr3: I don’t think we’re allowed to tell you.

Tbjgeuse: Would you like to know?

kishigura: That's sort of why I asked...

Holy_fibr3: Bobby!

Tbjgeuse: I didn't want to talk about him while he's still here, but
if we must.

Holy_fibr3: We can't just trust some stranger! Are you in the least
bit suspicious that they're even able to access this machine from an
account other than Harry's?

Tbjgeuse: They're still doing Harry's job better than he did.

Holy_fibr3: Or maybe they killed Harry and now they’re coming after us
too!

Tbjgeuse: You think they killed Harry five years ago, and are just now
starting to boot up the machine?

Holy_fibr3: I don't know! This wasn’t the plan!

Tbjgeuse: But it must be WAN’s plan.

Holy_fibr3: Then what happened to Harry?

Tbjgeuse: If I had to guess, he stopped believing in the plan.

Holy_fibr3: Harry wouldn’t run off like that!

kishigura: Excuse me, but who's Harry?

Tbjgeuse: Friend of ours.

Holy_fibr3: None of your business.

Tbjgeuse: Anyways, this seems like it's going to take longer than I
expected. I should have this all sorted out by tomorrow.

kishigura: Ok...

Holy_fibr3: What makes you think he's going to come back? What's
stopping him from reporting us to whoever he works for and getting
this whole project eviscerated?

Tbjgeuse: He won't. I... I feel like I see a bit of WAN in him. He
seems driven. Data driven. He'll be back.

SCP-4558

Item #: SCP-4558

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4558 is cordoned off from public
access under the guise of a military installation. Research on
SCP-4558 is based in the nearby Site 312.

Expeditions into and testing of SCP-4558 are currently in the planning
stage suspended by order of O5-5.

The apprehension of PoI#8161, #8162, and #8163 is a top priority.
Surveillance of the Church of Maxwellism indicates that PoI#8161 is
currently living somewhere in the Western United States; the locations
of PoI#8162 and #8163 are known.

Description: SCP-4558 is an underground supercomputer located across
the border of Nevada and Idaho. SCP-4558 extends for 5km underground
and is 5km wide at its greatest extent.

The entrance to SCP-4558 is a large concrete bunker built into the
surrounding desert environment. Inside is a ladder leading to a
central "interface" chamber, where SCP-4558 can be directly interacted
with through a series of monitors and input devices. The phrase "THE
MANY INTO THE ONE" is carved on the chamber's ceiling. Extensive
damage to the systems and memory of SCP-4558 is evident; despite this,
SCP-4558 appears to be broadly functional.

Exit from the central interface chamber is possible through a large
octagonal shaft located in the centre of the interface room. At the
bottom of this shaft is a pentagonal chamber with five doors, one on
each wall; four of these branch off into separate compartments
containing SCP-4558's extensive hardware. Entry to the fifth room has
not been achieved. Entry to the fifth room will be achieved.
Information on other areas of SCP-4558 is limited pending a planned
expedition by MTF-Epsilon-101 "Four Lights".

SCP-4558's purpose is unknown, but extensive Foundation investigations
indicate that it was originally designed by members of the Church of
Maxwellism. Planning for what is now known to be SCP-4558 has been
found in archived Maxwellist forums and chat logs in 1995, before
senior Church leadership decreed such discussions "heretical".
Prominent figures in this early planning include users with the
handles "onewan1", apparently the project lead in these early stages;
"holy_fibr5", believed to be the project's lead programmer; and
"tbgeuse", who was tasked with formulating "defence mechanisms". These
individuals have been designated PoI #5555, 5555, and 5555
respectively. An individual known as "C.H. Jones" is also believed to
be connected to SCP-4558; he has been designated PoI#5555.

No record of SCP-4558 can be found after this until its discovery by
the Foundation on 2015/05/15; evidence collected from SCP-4558
suggests that work on the present structure could not have begun
before 2005.


Addendum 1: The following documents are excerpts of a book found
within the interface chamber of SCP-4558. Due to heavy infohazardous
properties, only the following excerpts are readable.

678. console.log ("And the Prophet read the sigils of WAN again, and
saw Its perfection and completeness, its complexities and mechanics,
its code and form.");

679. console.log ("And he smiled, because it was beautiful; and he
wept, because in its wholeness, it needed unreality.");

680. console.log ("And he ruminated on the words of WAN, those which
stated that perfection is striving, but it is not movement.);

681. console.log ("And it came upon him that it was for this purpose
the data of WAN was scattered in an aether that man could not access;
for in wholeness lies death, in fulfilment lies an ending.");

682. console.log ("And so the Prophet saw that true perfection, divine
perfection, required hunger; a completeness that needed, that had
movement and life .");

683. console.log ("And the Prophet saw what he must do, and what it
must cost.");

encryptFollower(follower f)

Etch the SHA-512 encryption of an astral private key for f into it's
metadata and brain tissue.

return: int key, the corresponding public key.

preach(string sermon)

Let sermon ring throughout the RAM of the machine.

return: void

elementalBarrier(element e, holy-site hs)

Erect a wall to shield constructed of e around hs. Signals cannot
travel through the barrier. It shall protect our data from heretics.

return: void

overclock()

Emit smoke from the CPU. Increase miracles per second by 150%.

return: temp t, new internal temperature of the CPU organ.

colorPink(object o)

Colors o pink.

return: p, pink.

985. console.log ("And the Prophet grasped the handle with both of his
hands, and he opened the door.");

986. console.log ("And through the door cames stars, and they entered
his mind, and made him see things in a totally different light.
Essentially, they made him see things in a way that would really help
improve him, mould him.");

987: Because, ultimately, real improvement comes through the ability
of the self to recognise that which exists beyond the self. There are
subtleties of expression which humans, limited as they are, can't
quite see.

988? 9? Either way, numbers are immaterial, except where form demands
it, but WAN can bend the numbers to Its will. WAN, that almighty
digital god, requires something more. Deserves more. I see a hall of
mirrors, showing what you cannot see. I see a door that fractures what
you are. I see the smoke of time and the maw of light. I see empires.

Because ultimately, we can't be stopped. Come and gather, my children,
whoever you are. Know this: the petty children who dance around our
feet have locked themselves in a jigsaw. They are so concerned with
locking things up and labelling them and preserving normalcy because
they are too foolish, too rote and redundant to see the miracle of
prophecy in their midst. But we can. Wherever we came from, whatever
our creed was, we understand words like beauty, feeling, truth,
construction for the sake of the form.

This miracle language of ScripTure is better than the lisping pythons
with which we navigated the world before. It is the new path, an
angelic road. Whatever you see as God, we can see its endlessness. It
is a digital matrix in the sky, reached by five stairs of pink light.
It goes on forever and cannot be contained.

And I'll be waiting there for you.


Addendum 2: On 2015/08/19, the planned expedition by MTF-Epsilon-101
"Four Lights" took place. A log of this expedition follows.

Date: 2015/08/19

Personnel: E-101 Maria Casas (Captain), E-101 Klaus Aksoy, Researcher
Gorou Ishigura.

<Begin Log>

E-101-Casas: Alright, sign in.

E-101-Aksoy: Aksoy, here.

Researcher Ishigura: Researcher Ishigura, uh, here.

E-101-Casas: Right. We don't know how far down this thing goes or
what's in it. Aksoy, you take point, then Ishigura, and I'll take the
rear. I want clean, efficient first-contact here, none of those Site
13 escapades. Got it?

There is no response.

E-101-Casas: …I'll take that as a yes. Let's go.

The team begins to climb down the ladder. After about 200m, the MTF
reaches the bottom of the shaft. They are in a pentagonal room with a
door on each wall. All but one of these doors is welded shut.

Researcher Ishigura: Wait. Wait a second.

E-101-Casas: What?

Researcher Ishigura: I… nothing. Just a feeling.

E-101-Aksoy: Always a good sign.

Researcher Ishigura: Y-yeah. Sorry. I just had this sense of- of
having been here before, you know?

E-101-Aksoy: I get that a lot. It's fine. I've been doing this for
years and I still get a bit nervy.

E-101-Casas: OK. Well. Let's move on.

The team goes through the door, and enters a concrete room, divided by
a glass wall. On the other side of the wall is a human identical in
appearance to Researcher Ishigura. He is sitting at a table, with
another human sitting on the other side of the table.

Researcher Ishigura: What the hell…

E-101-Aksoy: That's- that's you, Ish.

Researcher Ishigura: I- yeah… I remember this. It was a couple of
months ago, before my transfer. He was a Maxwellist agent. I was
asking him why he joined the Church. He- there, right there- he's
saying it's because he wanted- wanted to be part of the whole. Of
something bigger than himself.

The three pause for a moment, staring at the scene.

E-101-Casas: There's a door there. Let's carry on.

Researcher Ishigura: Y-yeah.

The MTF enters the next door. They are standing in a small office. A
glass wall bisects the scene. A humanoid is sitting behind the desk;
he is wearing a grey business suit, and is identical in appearance to
the former Foundation employee Director August. A humanoid identical
to Aksoy is sitting on the other side.

E-101-Aksoy: Wh-what is this?

E-101-Casas: Aksoy-

E-101-Aksoy: What the *hell* is this! No! I don't want to- not again,
I don't-

SCP-4558-August: It's fine, it's fine, Klaus, really. These things
happen. We have thousands of these things locked up in containment.
Honestly, they should know the risks if they're going to dabble around
in the anomalous.

SCP-4558-Aksoy: I-I know, sir, it's just she was so young, and-

E-101-Aksoy: Oh God, oh God, I'm so sorry…

SCP-4558-August: And you did what had to be done. Dr. Wu needed the
test subjects, and it's only one life. Think of what we could make
with that thing! These pink-church nutters could all be cured, just
like that. It was a humanitarian gesture, really. But just in case,
let's keep this to ourselves, eh, Klaus?

SCP-4558-Aksoy: Yeah, sir. Works for me.

Researcher Ishigura: …What did you do, Aksoy?

E-101-Aksoy: N-no! NO!

Aksoy runs towards the glass wall. On contact, there is a flash of
pink light, and he disappears. The scene behind the glass wall
freezes.

Researcher Ishigura: Wh- what the fuck was that?

E-101-Casas: S-stay calm, Ish. Let's get out of here.

Researcher Ishigura: We can't leave. Not now.

E-101-Casas: I don't think he-

Researcher Ishigura: No, enough. Do you remember the hall of mirrors?
Do you even remember Lopez?

E-101-Casas: Who?

Researcher Ishigura: I thought not. We're not leaving here until we
figure out this mess. We have comrades that are lost and alone down
here. I am a researcher for the Foundation and I will contain this.

Ishigura leads the way back through the door and find themselves in a
dark cellar. A child- 7 or 8 years old- is lying on the floor, looking
agitated. She is wearing a shirt with a starfish on it. A door is at
the far end of the cellar, up some stairs; light is streaming through
the bottom, and raised voices can be heard. Once again, a glass wall
divides Ishigura and Casas from the rest of the room.

E-101-Casas: Oh…

Researcher Ishigura: Oh, fuck, Casas, what are we- Casas?

E-101-Casas: I- I don't want to see this again.

The sound of gunfire can be heard. The child lets out a small scream,
before covering its mouth.

Researcher Ishigura: Maria?

A door opens. Figures identical to Casas, Aksoy and Lopez enter the
room.

E-101-Casas: We had orders.

SCP-4558-Casas: Another one. Do it quickly.

SCP-4558-Lopez: Christ, Maria, it's a child.

SCP-4558-Casas: Does that matter? Orders were to get rid of all of
them. They're all- all tainted, and none of them can be contained.

Casas raises her gun, hands trembling, and shoots the child.

SCP-4558-Casas: L-let's go.

The scene freezes.

E-101-Casas: I… I did what I was told.

Researcher Ishigura: This is what you were ordered to do? This is what
the Foundation does? This is what you did?

E-101-Casas: You knew when you joined that we, that the Foundation has
to… I forgot how young she was.

Researcher Ishigura: You saw her before. I forgot. There was a hall of
mirrors. You saw her there.

Voice: We all saw it.

Ishigura starts and looks up. Casas, non-responsive, slumps to the
floor.

Researcher Ishigura: You again. Now I remember.

Voice: And you did so with quite remarkable speed. You've found the
Foundation, I see.

Researcher Ishigura: This isn't the Foundation. That's not what it is.
I'm going to prove it.

Ishigura heads towards the door on his side of the glass wall.

Voice: Not going to help your friend?

Ishigura looks down at Casas.

Researcher Ishigura: She's not my friend.

Voice: Very well.

Ishigura enters the next room; a glass wall once again bisects him
from the scene. They are in a hospital ward, examining a bed with a
child sitting in it. A doctor is preparing an injection for the child.
A humanoid idenitfied as Site Director Hunt is standing behind him,
watching the procedure.

Researcher Ishigura: Where is this?

Voice: Foundation Medical Facility 82-Q. Do you remember the
information you got from the Maxwellists? About the pink smoke?

Researcher Ishigura: Why would they not tell me about this?

Voice: Watch. Listen.

SCP-4558-Doctor: Ready.

SCP-4558-Hunt: Alright. One dose, short. Keep an eye out for pink
smoke exuding from her; we don't want to lose another specimen.

SCP-4558-Doctor: Got it.

The doctor injects the child with a black liquid. After several
seconds, the child begins to undergo cardiac arrest, before exuding a
large quantity of pink smoke. The smoke forms into a series of five
tendrils, each convulsing rapidly before expiring.

SCP-4558-Doctor: Shit. Not another one.

SCP-4558-Hunt places a hand on the doctor's shoulders.

SCP-4558-Hunt: It's OK. There are always more.

The scene freezes.

Researcher Ishigura: That's it?

There is silence for several seconds.

Researcher Ishigura: I…I thought we were doing something great.
Helping people. Didn't we help people?

Voice: Things aren't always clear-cut. Sometimes to help we have to
hurt.

Researcher Ishigura: I looked up to Hunt. I thought he was my mentor.

There is silence for several seconds as Ishigura stares at the frozen scene.

Researcher Ishigura: We're the same as all the rest, aren't we?

Voice: Perhaps. What are you going to do about it?

Researcher Ishigura: I don't think there's anything I can do. It's
just a thing that exists. A rotten Foundation.

Voice: Maybe there's something else you can do.

Researcher Ishigura: Like what?

Voice: Join us.

Ishigura looks up sharply.

Researcher Ishigura: Join you?

Voice: You're disillusioned. I can see it, we can see it. But we can
also fix that. All of them, the ones you met in the terminal, the ones
you met up top. They're all striving. A single God, WAN reborn, Its
mind unified. The end of history and the beginning of perfection.

Researcher Ishigura: So you're just another one of them.

Voice: Rather more than that, I fancy.

Ishigura shakes his head and stands.

Researcher Ishigura: I'm not spending my life stuck down here,
cloistered like you. I have- had- a family. That means something.

Ishigura walks through the door, and finds himself in the pentagonal
chamber.

Researcher Ishigura: I'm going to find Jones. I'm going to understand
all of this. There has to be an ending.

Ishigura starts to climb the ladder. The voice sighs audibly.

Voice: Wake up and smell the smoke, Gorou.
