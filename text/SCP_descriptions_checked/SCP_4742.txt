Item #: SCP-4742 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4742 is stored in a standard low-security 
containment locker. Excess dorayaki produced by SCP-4742 is to be used for 
feeding of sustenance-requiring anomalies. 

Description: SCP-4742 is a 1.5 m tall plastic statue of the character Doraemon 
from the Japanese franchise of the same name. SCP-4742 produces one hundred 
loaves of dorayaki1 per day at varying intervals from a small aperture in its 
abdomen, which is deposited into its "pouch". Examination of the inside of 
SCP-4742 reveals that it is composed of machinery designed for the manufacturing 
of dorayaki from its raw ingredients. The source of these ingredients is 
unknown; therefore, it is believed that SCP-4742 violates the law of 
conservation of mass. Attempts to observe the process have failed due to the 
fact that SCP-4742 halts production of dorayaki when not fully intact. 

The dorayaki produced is non-anomalous; however, those who consume it report it 
to be of exceptional quality. 

UPDATE: On 2008-09-28, SCP-4742 was lost following a Chaos Insurgency raid on 
Site-11. Efforts to relocate SCP-4742 are deemed low-priority.

Item #: SCP-4742

Object Class: Safe Keter

Special Containment Procedures: There are currently no feasible means
of fully containing SCP-4742 with the Foundation's available
resources. Provisional Area-4742 has been established at the former
Insurgency base surrounding SCP-4742 for observation of the main body
and communication with the entity. No efforts to destroy the main body
of SCP-4742 are to be carried out.

Under no circumstances is any imagery related to the Chaos Insurgency
to enter Provisional Area-4742.

ATTACHED NOTICE: URGENT SECURITY ALERT

Since 2012-04-02, Foundation personnel have reported receiving
suspicious messages from a number of secure Foundation addresses. The
bodies of such messages were found to contain lethal cognitohazardous
imagery and phrases. Due to a correlation between the frequency of
these messages and the activity of SCP-4742, it is believed that
SCP-4742 is responsible for the generation of these messages.

For your safety:

Change your account password immediately.

Report all suspicious activity, of your account and of others, to the
Department of Informational Security.

Access Foundation-secure networks only when Stonewall-Pine
cognitohazard censors are in effect.

Do not open any suspicious messages.

Description: SCP-4742 is a sapient intelligence contained within a
massive mechanical expanse located at Provisional Area-4742. The main
body of SCP-4742 contains numerous visual aspects reminiscent of the
character Doraemon from the Japanese franchise of the same name.

SCP-4742 exhibits thaumaturgic, ectoentropic, and cognitohazardous
properties. Due to the magnitude of these abilities, SCP-4742 is
effectively a Type Green entity, although it has no noticeable effect
on Hume levels and does not respond to Scranton Reality Anchors.
SCP-4742 is sapient and exhibits highly developed intelligence,
manifesting in numerous communication attempts with Foundation
personnel, all of which have ended in violent reactions from the
entity. All attempts to destroy the main body have failed and resulted
in increasingly hostile responses from SCP-4742.

Developed by the Insurgency in 2010, it is believed that SCP-4742
produced anomalous weaponry for the organization on a massive scale.
Anomalous modifications by the Insurgency have almost completely
repurposed the original form of SCP-4742, though elements of it remain
in certain locations. Since the events of 2012-03-31, SCP-4742 has
halted all production of weaponry.

The weaponry produced by SCP-4742 is believed to be related to a spike
in aggressive Insurgency activity since 2010.


Addendum 4742-1: SCP-4742 was originally a Safe-class object that
produced one hundred dorayaki1 a day. On 2008-09-03, a Chaos
Insurgency raid on Site-118 resulted in the loss of 13 anomalies,
including SCP-4742. It is believed that over the course of two years,
the Insurgency subjected SCP-4742 to numerous anomalous modifications
until it became capable of its current operations.

On 2012-03-31, at 0010 hours GMT, Foundation entropic detectors in the
southeast Pacific detected a sharp spike in ectoentropic activity.
Triangulating the origin revealed the presence of a small, previously
undiscovered island 500 km north of the Marquesas Islands. Theorizing
the area to be the location of SCP-4742, MTF Nu-1 ("Boxkillers") was
mobilized and deployed. Upon arrival, fifty-three deceased Insurgency
operatives were found. Autopsy reports reveal that each expired due to
multiple organ failure likely caused by spontaneous cardiac
displacement. Numerous antiperceptual engines were discovered, all of
which appear to have violently exploded, believed to have powered the
antiperceptual field hindering the site's discovery. SCP-4742 in its
current form was located at 0205 hours.

SCP-4742

Item #: SCP-4742

Object Class: Keter Euclid (provisional)

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4742 is stored in a standard
high-security containment chamber. Any deviation in behavior or
appearance of SCP-4742 must be reported to Site High Command.

By order of the Overseer Council, no testing with SCP-4742 is to take
place.

Description: SCP-4742 is a 1.5 m tall plastic statue of the character
Doraemon from the Japanese franchise of the same name. SCP-4742
produces one hundred loaves of dorayaki1 per day at varying intervals
from a small aperture in its abdomen, which is deposited into its
"pouch". Examination of the inside of SCP-4742 reveals that it is
composed of machinery designed for the manufacturing of dorayaki from
its raw ingredients. The source of these ingredients is unknown and
there is no evidence of external inputs; therefore, SCP-4742 violates
the law of conservation of mass. Attempts to observe the process have
failed due to the fact that SCP-4742 halts production of dorayaki when
not fully intact.

The dorayaki produced is non-anomalous; however, those who consume it
report it to be of exceptional quality.

Addendum 4742-1: History

From its initial discovery on 2006-04-21 to its seizure by the Chaos
Insurgency on 2008-09-28, SCP-4742 was a Safe-class object in a form
near-identical to its current state, producing one hundred loaves of
dorayaki per day. After its rediscovery on 2012-03-31 in a heavily
modified form, SCP-4742 was subsequently reclassified as Keter.

SCP-4742 was provisionally reclassified as Euclid following the events
of 2012-06-04.

At 0322 hours GMT, the main body of SCP-4742 deployed a self-propelled
projectile, initially presumed to be an act of hostility.

At 0323 hours, the projectile landed at the coordinates 36.5122° N,
136.9006° E with no immediate effect.

At 0325 hours, Foundation operatives discovered an object visually
identical to SCP-4742's original form at the landing site of the
projectile in the city of Nanto, Toyama Prefecture, Japan.

At 0326 hours, the main body of SCP-4742 ceased all signs of activity.
The object discovered at the landing site was subsequently
reclassified as SCP-4742.

Further analysis of SCP-4742 has revealed the presence of mechanical
elements resembling that of its previously modified form; however,
they are believed to have been rendered permanently inactive. The
behavior of SCP-4742 is now identical to its behavior prior to its
seizure by the Insurgency.
