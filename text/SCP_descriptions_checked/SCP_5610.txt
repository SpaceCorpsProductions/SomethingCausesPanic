Item #: 5610 

Containment Class: Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5610 events are to be minimally monitored. 

Meanwhile, a study of all cultures with a particular focus on shame and facades1 
is to be initiated for any relations with SCP-5610. All historical documents 
related to felines are to be also investigated. 

Description: SCP-5610 is an anomalous entity that is only observable by 
individuals with a cognitive resistance value of 5.6 and above. Approximately 56 
percent of Japan's population has been found to have an instance of SCP-5610 
resting atop of their head. However, no discomfort is felt by the subject these 
instances are resting on. 

As a subject's behavior in public becomes more congruent to their behavior in 
private, the instance of SCP-5610 becomes increasingly detailed. This continues 
until it produces one of two results: either the instance would vanish, or in 
approximately six percent of all cases, it transforms into a non-anomalous 
cat(Felis catus) and jumps off the subject's head. 

SCP-5610 is prominently featured in haikus; living authors, when questioned, 
remember it. Notable ones are translated below. 

It is humankind 

To put a cat on the head2 

To love and hate swords 

-Oda Nobunaga, 1580 


When a child suckles, 

The cat inside him also does, 

Partnered on rough paths 

-Basho, 1672 


Are we not all cats 

On heads of weak, chatting mice 

Or hardened tigers? 

-Emiri Takagata, 1923 


To the barrack bed, 

An old cat jumps from my head 

Meowing with pity 

-Jou Takamiki, 1944 


Bored, Oneko3 sighs, 

Telling me to cry for him 

Yet I save face, tears 

-Deo Takamiki, 1944 


Banging the weak wall, 

From my rotten, though shined crown 

A cat skitters through 

-Aiko Torikatsu, 1976 


The cat leaves haughty, 

My thoughts, like leaves on a pond 

Float in unison 

-Moeka Horinami, 1980 


Reflections of mine 

A cat claws back from the top 

I smile sadly now 

-Haruki Murakami, 1998 


Update: Several historical records in Egypt, dating as far back as 3500 B.C. 
have been noted for indicating manifestations of SCP-5610.
