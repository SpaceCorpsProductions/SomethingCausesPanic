NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION

This document has been noted to contain an unusually resilient
infohazard that has resisted all efforts to eliminate it. Any attempt
to access SCP-2998 documentation forces users to sequentially access a
series of untrue and misleading iterations of that documentation.
Please sequence through these files; you will be notified when you
have reached the correct documentation. We apologize for the

Item #: SCP-2998 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: The Foundation has modified radio frequency and 
electronics manufacturing standards worldwide to avoid civilian production of 
devices capable of receiving SCP-2998. Internet, radio, and print communications 
monitoring efforts by relevant Foundation departments are to be on alert for 
images or descriptions relating to SCP-2998. The frequency on which SCP-2998 is 
broadcast is to be monitored regularly for any change in SCP-2998 content. All 
extraterrestrial vessels and probes are to be modified covertly to include 
equipment designed to monitor for the presence of SCP-2998 off-world. Research 
to determine the source of SCP-2998 and the background behind its content is to 
continue as a Class 6 priority effort. 

Description: SCP-2998 is an electromagnetic signal with a constant frequency of 
2485 MHz. Its power and origin cannot be determined; the signal appears to be 
invariably present at all locations throughout the known solar system. The 
signal was believed initially to be an anomalous but innocuous white noise 
present at that frequency; minor variances suggested the presence of some other 
information within the signal, but no means to decode SCP-2998 were developed 
until 2011. 

The signal was found to contain a digital video transmission with a monaural 
track. The video appears to depict a humanoid entity of an unknown species 
floating in a dark room; while no context is provided for the image, the 
reflexive body language and high-pitched noises being emitted by the entity seem 
to suggest it is in extreme physical distress. No other entities have been seen 
within the video feed and no external source of harm has been noted. However, 
certain features within the image suggest that some sort of abnormal telekinetic 
phenomena are occurring; the entity frequently appears to be pushed or moved, 
and brief images of background objects within the room suggest that some 
gravitational field is present, implying the entity's midair position is not due 
to zero-gravity conditions and the entity is being held in place by an unknown 
force. 


Addendum 2998-A: SCP-2998 has been theorized to contain additional information 
that has yet to be decoded. Some components of the TV signal currently appear as 
noise by Foundation decoding techniques; several researchers involved with 
SCP-2998 have concluded that this would not be expected, given the complexity of 
the encoding and transmission technologies behind SCP-2998. Current theories 
include three-dimensional stereoscopic data, some kind of [DATA EXPUNGED] neural 
activity.

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: The Foundation has modified radio
frequency and electronics manufacturing standards worldwide to avoid
civilian production of devices capable of receiving SCP-2998.
Internet, radio, and print communications monitoring efforts by
relevant Foundation departments are to be on alert for images or
descriptions relating to SCP-2998. Additionally, personnel and D-class
are to be exposed to the signal associated with SCP-2998 in order to
determine eligibility for Project Rosetta and permanent assignment to
SCP-2998.

The frequency on which SCP-2998 is broadcast is to be monitored

Description: SCP-2998 is an electromagnetic signal with a constant
frequency of 2485 MHz. Its power and origin cannot be determined; the
signal appears to be invariably present at all locations throughout
the known solar system. The signal seems to lack a single point of
origin; rather, current analysis suggests SCP-2998 is being broadcast
with a power of 1.86 mW, which in combination with the large coverage
area of SCP-2998 suggests that multiple [DATA EXPUNGED] in size. The
signal was believed initially to be an anomalous but innocuous white
noise present at that frequency; minor variances suggested the
presence of some other information within the signal, but no means to

Addendum 2998-B: While no mechanical or technological means have yet
been devised for decoding the data within SCP-2998 previously
considered extraneous, Incidents 2998-Beta and 2998-Epsilon have
revealed that certain humans possess unusual neurological traits
(presently believed to be an abnormal nerve bundle connecting Brodmann
areas 41 and 42 to the dorsal amygdala) that allow them to perceive
additional informational output from SCP-2998 in the form of simulated
emotional connections. A full transcript of the debriefing of affected
personnel D-099238 and D-398398 has been classified Level 4; access to

are to be exposed to the signal associated with SCP-2998 in order to

SCP-2998; no other method has thus far been developed of determining
the presence of a functional Rosetta cluster in humans.

The frequency on which SCP-2998 is broadcast is to be monitored
regularly for any change in SCP-2998 content. Additionally,
individuals determined to be Rosetta-positive are to be exposed to
SCP-2998 for at least twelve hours of every day, followed by
debriefing to gather more intelligence regarding SCP-2998 and the
species responsible for its generation. All extraterrestrial vessels

origin; rather, current analysis suggests SCP-2998 is being broadcast
with a power of 1.86 mW, which in combination with the large coverage
area of SCP-2998 suggests that the signal is being broadcast in a
fashion that transcends 4-dimensional space, emerging into
conventional space in a three-dimensional grid pattern with
transmission points spaced approximately three meters apart. As the
signal has been found to be ubiquitous by every receiver capable of
detecting it both on- and off-Earth, it is presently believed that
SCP-2998 may be broadcasting throughout the universe simultaneously.

The signal was believed initially to be an anomalous but innocuous

position is not due to zero-gravity conditions and the entity is being
held in place by an unknown force.

In addition to the video and audio tracks, an additional component of
the signal is perceivable only by individuals possessing a specific
abnormal nerve bundle connecting Brodmann areas 41 and 42 to the
dorsal amygdala in the temporal lobe of the brain. Individuals
possessing the nerve bundle report hearing an unusual high-pitched
sound alongside the monaural audio of SCP-2998, then begin
experiencing a form of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy characterized by
complex partial seizures. During seizures, affected individuals begin
speaking in a form of glossolalia, speaking near-constantly without
any apparent meaning. The seizures will continue as long as the
individual is exposed to the SCP-2998 audio track; the glossolalia
will develop over time into a more coherent messages. The nerve bundle
has been nicknamed the "Rosetta cluster" by Foundation Medical's
research division, due to the ability of individuals in possession of
it to "translate" the signal's otherwise indecipherable components.
Both individuals thus far found to be in possession of the Rosetta
cluster have retained some memories from their experiences.

initial exposure to SCP-2998


Interview 2998-Beta: Debriefing of D-099238 by Foundation Intelligence
interrogation specialist Stephen Nissentra

Agent Nissentra: Could you describe your experience with SCP-2998?

D-099238: They brought me in to clean the room. One guy, a researcher,
I guess, sitting and watching TV. I didn't know what he was watching,
figured it was some weird shit, didn't pay much attention to it.
Wasn't my first time, you know? I had just started sweeping when I got
this hot feeling, like a fever. I sort of felt myself falling, but I
didn't feel the ground.

Nissentra: What did you experience during your seizure?

099238: They told me it was a seizure afterward. It was more like one
of those dreams you have when you're a kid, you know? When you're
really sick, and they give you NyQuil or something. It was like real
life, but everything was just huge all around me. I can't remember a
lot of details.

Nissentra: During your episode, you repeated certain phrases several
times. May I ask if you recall any of them in particular?

099238 You can, sure, but I doubt I can help.

Nissentra: During moments when the SCP-2998 entity was silent, you
were heard to say "All glory Adidal, all glory Adidal" somewhat
quietly several times. What does —"

099238: (slurring) All glory Adidal. All power. All fall before
Adidal. All light bends. All sound spreads. All glory.

A pause.

099238: I remember some of what it was. It wasn't like seeing or
hearing so much. It was just feeling. I felt something large, so, so
large. Above me. All around me. It was looking at the universe with a
sort of…it was this, this feeling…like when you have plants inside on
a windowsill, yeah? And you see them growing, and you feel like you
have a part in it, but it's just so beneath you. So small. It was the
way you feel when you're a kid and you do something cute and you watch
your dad smile at you.

The subject was silent for several minutes.

099238: And then I heard the screaming, the sound they told me was
coming from the TV. It was loud, so loud in my head.

Nissentra: Could you understand what the creature was saying?

099238: Ruhar.

Nissentra: Excuse me?

The subject's eyes unfocused. The subject's voice became slurred.

099238: The accursed was known as Ruhar before its crime. It knows no
sound but screams.

D-099238 experienced nasal hemorrhage and lost consciousness at this
point.


Note: D-398398's Rosetta cluster was noted as being slightly more
developed than that of D-099238.


Interview 2998-Epsilon: Debriefing of D-398398 by Foundation
Intelligence interrogation specialist Stephen Nissentra.

Agent Nissentra: Could you describe your experience with SCP-2998?

D-398398: I was brought in as part of a, a focus group, I guess? They
brought all the D-class from our site in in groups of ten. Reminded me
of the line-up. They turned on a TV and showed us what was going on.

Nissentra: How did you react to the images on the TV?

D-398398: It was like I got drunk all at once, super fast. I felt
myself falling to the ground, and then it was…

[pause]

398398: It wasn't like anything, but if you had to put it…it was like
if you went to a 3D movie in Japanese or something, something where
you don't speak the language, but it has this perfect surround sound,
and you can feel and smell and taste it, too. That's what I was
seeing. But everyone else, everyone looking at the TV? What they're
seeing is like if you shot that movie with a camcorder and played it
on a TV, and then shot the TV with a cell phone camera. Everyone else
looked at the TV and saw the cell phone video, and I think I was the
only one who was following the plot. I was the only one who could see
the subtitles.

Nissentra: What is the plot? What were you seeing?

398398: It's…I could tell that I wasn't seeing it the way one of them
would see it, but I understood it in some of the terms we would use. I
saw this movie about this guy, this bigshot guy, like a Capone. A
shot-caller, somebody with that kind of power where you can't even
imagine how far he can reach. I keep calling it a he, but I don't
think they got men and women like we do. And along comes this other
guy in the neighborhood. If the first guy's like a Capone, this is
somebody who wants to be Bugs Moran, right? Challenge the big man on
the block, prove he ain't all he says he is. But this wannabe guy, he
knows he'd be crazy going after the Capone guy himself, right? So he
goes after the guy's family. Hopes to send a message.

Nissentra: What did he do?

398398: That part…it got sort of fuzzy. I don't think we have an idea
in any language we have for what these people can do to each other
when they want somebody else to be hurt the way this guy did it. It
wasn't just physical, and it wasn't just psychological. I don't even
think it fits in space and time the way we understand it. But this guy
goes after Capone's…let's say wife, and maybe whatever they have
instead of kids too. And this Capone — I can't remember his name —

Nissentra: Was it "Adidal"?

398398: Adidal knows all and sees all. All praise to Adidal that knows
us. All praise to Adidal that sees us. All glory.

Subject pauses. Subject's head begins to sag, but lifts up. A small
trickle of blood drips from the subject's nose.

398398: I'm sorry, it comes over me sometimes. I don't think it leaves
you once you see it. But anyway, the Ad…the Capone guy, he decides he
wants to send a message of his own. Only not to one person. He's gonna
keep this poor bastard alive and suffering forever, and right out in
public. No legends, no word of mouth. He wants the evidence available
for anyone to see, anyone who even thinks about going up against him.

Nissentra: Do you have any information about "Ruhar"?

398398: The accursed was known as Ruhar before its crime. It knows no
sound but screams.

Subject's breathing intensifies, but subject remains conscious. The
blood coming from the subject's nose intensifies.

Nissentra: Can you elaborate at all? Is Ruhar the individual in the
transmission?

398398: The accursed was known as Ruhar before its crime. Eternal
shall be its suffering. It shall suffer when all light in the cosmos
grows dark. It shall suffer when all life in this cosmos lies dead. It
shall suffer when all time in this cosmos runs down. Its suffering
will be true when there is no truth it—

The subject loses consciousness.

SCP-2998

Item #: SCP-2998

Object Class: Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2998 has been reclassified as
Neutralized as of 20/03/2016 after over eighteen months of
non-transmission of the anomalous signal carried thereupon. Efforts
are to be continued to locate and recapture all escaped Site 83
personnel (currently numbering eight (8) D-class individuals), all of
whose connection to SCP-2998 is considered relevant at this time.

Special Containment Procedures v. 3.3 (30/03/14)

The Foundation has modified radio frequency and electronics
manufacturing standards worldwide to avoid civilian production of
devices capable of receiving SCP-2998. Internet, radio, and print
communications monitoring efforts by relevant Foundation departments
are to be on alert for images or descriptions relating to SCP-2998.
Additionally, personnel and D-class are to be exposed to the signal
associated with SCP-2998 in order to determine eligibility for Project
Rosetta and permanent assignment to SCP-2998; no other method has thus

further background behind its content is to continue as a Class 2
priority effort.

Description: SCP-2998 was identified as an electromagnetic signal with
a constant frequency of 2485 MHz. The anomalous signal ceased
transmission on 05/03/2013 and no further unusual behavior has been
identified at that frequency.

Description v. 2.1 (30/03/14)

SCP-2998 is an electromagnetic signal with a constant frequency of
2485 MHz. Its power and origin cannot be determined; the signal
appears to be invariably present at all locations throughout the known
solar system. The signal seems to lack a single point of origin;

Addendum 2998-B: Incident 2998-Zeta

On 11/09/14, researchers noticed unusual activity from the
transmission feed. The alien humanoid depicted on the SCP-2998
transmission ceased exhibiting signs of physical distress for an
extended period of time; while this was a typical and expected
component of the feed, this quiet period continued for much longer
than was usual. During the quiet period, the eight D-class individuals
being exposed to SCP-2998 in accordance with Project Rosetta
experienced simultaneous tonic-clonic seizures, events that had not
been previously noted by SCP-2998 researchers. The alien humanoid
remained seemingly unconscious for several minutes after the D-class
were removed from the room; the broadcast ceased shortly thereafter.

During transfer to Medical Site-47, all eight D-class individuals
successfully overwhelmed the lightly-armed transport team while
feigning unconsciousness and fled Foundation custody. The eight
individuals displayed an unusual amount of cooperation during the
escape attempt, given that none of the D-class had been permitted to
speak to one another during their time with SCP-2998 and none are
believed to have known one another at any point prior to their
assignment to SCP-2998. Additionally, SCP Medical Division had
theorized that continued SCP-2998 exposure had caused partial gross
motor deficiencies due to neural atrophy. Recapture and interrogation
of the eight D-class personnel is considered a Class 3 priority
effort.

SCP-2998 (LEVEL 4 ACCESS ONLY)

SCP-2998 reinstated and reclassified Keter 15/12/16; this
documentation published 11/02/17.

This document is for consumption by Level 4 personnel and above.
Details of this document are not to be disclosed to lower-level
personnel without prior approval.

Item #: SCP-2998

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Containment of SCP-2998-A is not
currently considered possible with available technology. Foundation
efforts are to be concentrated on planetary defense as first priority.
Foundation Research is developing theoretical means of offensive
measures against SCP-2998-A.

Full containment of SCP-2998-B is not possible at present with
available technology. Propaganda efforts are to be made to discourage
use of technology that requires reception of electromagnetic signals,
including radio, television, and Internet. Operation Blackout is
currently under consideration as a more complete containment method
for SCP-2998-B; Level 5 personnel are permitted access to Document
2998-Delta containing details of Operation Blackout. All Foundation
facilities listed as Priority 2 or higher are to begin preparations
for Operation Blackout; all Foundation facilities listed as Priority 3
or lower are to begin preparations for evacuation or abandonment of
their facilities. See Document 2998-Omicron for lists of SCP items
considered eligible for summary decommissioning in the event that
their transfer reduces the efficiency of evacuation efforts.

Civilians believed to be SCP-2998-C instances are to be terminated on
sight by any Foundation personnel. Behavior indicative of SCP-2998-C
instances include: periodic gross motor deficiency, advanced
cooperation between individuals without verbal communication, unusual
but frequent hemorrhaging, and any questionable use of the word
“Adidal.” Foundation personnel suspected of SCP-2998-B infection are
to be detained until thorough interrogation or examination can be
conducted. Unit and Site commanders are to have complete
jurisdictional authority over their subordinates with regards to
SCP-2998-C containment and suppression; decisions made in this area
are not subject to external review.

All lower levels of Foundation personnel are to be provided with
documents containing need-to-know information for operational use,
along with RAISA-designed propaganda intended to improve morale. All
levels are to believe their operational documents represent the
highest level of informational awareness.

Description: SCP-2998 identifies all anomalous phenomena associated
with the 12/12/2016 extraterrestrial incursion into translunar space.
SCP-2998-A describes the alien object occupying the Earth-Moon L5
position. The object consists of five hundred twelve (512) spheroidal
pods linked to a cylindrical central axis by flexible tethers. The
propulsion method of the object is unknown; the object appears to be
obscuring its own energy output, though each of the pods seem to
propel themselves independently of but in conjunction with the central
axis. Whether the object is manned, controlled remotely, or operating
with an autonomous AI is unknown.

SCP-2998-B describes all electromagnetic signals emitting from
SCP-2998-A. These signals often vary in frequency, amplitude, and
wavelength, and may be transmitted either as broadcast or narrowband
signals; their common features appear to be their alien origin and
their purpose, which is to create instances of SCP-2998-C. SCP-2998-B
signals have been transmitted along most of the frequencies and
wavelengths used by human technology, including radio, television,
Wi-Fi, cellular telephone, and GPS devices.

SCP-2998-C describes all humans that have been exposed to SCP-2998-B
and are operating under the control or influence of SCP-2998-A.
SCP-2998-C instances comprise approximately 3,400 individuals at last
estimate, not including 5,238 individuals captured or terminated by
Foundation authorities. SCP-2998-C appear to possess a series of
motivations, including the [DATA EXPUNGED—SEE DOCUMENT 2998-Ы]


Document 2998-Ы: Five instances of SCP-2998-C have been captured alive
in the two months since the alien incursion to the time of this
writing. Three of these instances were able to commit suicide through
various improvised means, frequently using their teeth or nearby
objects. One of these instances was uncooperative and succeeded in
destroying her vocal apparati and causing herself sufficient brain
damage to render her uncommunicative. SCP-2998-C-Gamma was
successfully captured and transferred to Site-203 for interrogation.
The following interview was conducted by Containment Specialist II
Barbara Whitman; no intelligence retrieval technicians were available
to conduct the interview.


Containment Specialist Whitman: Can you enter your name into the
record?

The subject is bleeding heavily from the nose and ears, though no
cause for the bleeding was ascertained.

SCP-2998-C-Gamma: No name you what we. Body shell. Name it not know.
No name we.

Whitman: Can you describe the function of the object in orbit around
our planet?

Gamma: No planet you. Planet aaaaaaaa —

Bleeding intensifies.

Gamma: Planet Adidal. You Adidal. All Adidal. Adidal you praise.
Adidal you praise will. Adidal all praise will.

Whitman: Can you describe the reason for your entry into our solar
system?

Gamma: No solar system you. Solar system Adidal. All Adidal —

Whitman: (interrupting) Why…are…you…here?

Gamma: Darkness here. Scum here. It Adidal hurt here. It Adidal hurt
come back. It Adidal hurt hurt more. It Adidal hurt hurt all time.
Adidal make Ruhar hurt.

Whitman: Ruhar is here? How?

Gamma: No name we. Sometimes body we. Sometimes thought we. Idea we.
Ruhar idea make here. Ruhar idea in one here.

Whitman: Again, how is the fugitive here?

Gamma: Adidal Ruhar hurt. Adidal Ruhar hurt, make idea not make out.
Make out other place. Ruhar idea not leave. You —

Blood begins emitting from tear ducts.

Gamma: You make Ruhar leave, you look Ruhar. Thing in you. Thing in
you good idea us live. Ruhar one us. Ruhar leave into you. We leave
into you. We Ruhar look will. We Ruhar find will. You in way. You in
way we forget.

Whitman: You…you forget us? What does that mean?

Gamma: Idea you we forget. Idea you we make forget. You in way, we
idea you make forget. Make forget all time. No one idea you remember.
We make you gone. We make you no place.


Site-203 was attacked and overwhelmed by SCP-2998-C instances four
hours after the conclusion of the interview.

Heed Now All True Souls The Most High Words Of Your Chaplains
Regarding: The Enemy

A prayer is given first for absolution.1 Documentarians of the True
Foundation are forced by technical restrictions to use the impure
templates of an organization preceding the Cleansing. Focus your
hearts on the content of the message and do not allow the heresies of
the impure dead to influence you. Report any such influence to your
local Spiritual Chaplain's office.

This knowledge blessed by They-That-Watched-Over (secure contain
protect us all) and dispensed this twelfth day of the third month of
the Sixth True Year.

Item #: SCP-2998

Object Class: Nehemoth

Special Containment Procedures: Kill the Enemy where possible. Do not
attack the Enemy unless you are in force and can do so without
sacrificing your position. Do not allow the Enemy to see you during
attack, and leave the area after the attack to avoid reprisal. Hide in
a secluded location after a successful attack and do not return home
for three (3) days. Do not allow the Enemy to capture crusaders. Make
martyrs of the crusaders that are taken by the Enemy, for their trials
shall be overmuch and the danger to the True Foundation is limitless.
Crusaders that allow comrades to be taken alive by the enemy shall be
punished with termination. Do not capture the Enemy! Their craft
allows them to track their fellow devils and our home shall be
threatened.

Kill the enemy where possible. Use stealth at all times. Do not allow
the enemy to see you, for they may report your position to their
masters. Do not capture live enemy! Their masters can track them to
our home if they are alive. The crusaders most successful in capturing
enemy each month will be rewarded with increased rations.

Kill the enemy at will. Bring the enemy home for assignment to
Recycling Duty. Do not listen to the enemy! His lies are poison to
crusaders of the True Foundation! The crusaders most successful in
capturing enemy each month will be rewarded with increased rations.

Description: SCP-2998-A is the Enemy. The Enemy's soldiers take the
form of beings of a similar shape as humans, appearing entirely black2
with a hardened, nonsegmented carapace. The anatomy of Enemy soldiers
is not understood; no tools currently in the possession of the True
Foundation can penetrate their skin. Rumors of their internal anatomy
spread or gathered from the enemy are considered Level 2 Heresies and
may not be repeated aloud. The weapons of the Enemy are not understood
by the True Foundation, but it is a certainty that they are effective
only on those crusaders that allow themselves to be struck by those
weapons. There is no need for knowledge of the tools of the Enemy
where avoidance of the Enemy will suffice.

SCP-2998-B is the enemy. The enemy consists of those humans seduced by
the song and signals of the Enemy into joining their ranks. The vast
majority of the enemy were recruited during the Air Wave Corruption
that heralded the end of the last era; any humanity within them was
lost in the years since. Some records from the impure organization
that preceded the Cleansing suggest that the Enemy possesses
attributes that render humans unable to resist their signals. The True
Foundation considers all words of the impure to be Heresies of various
levels; however, many Chaplains have granted moral forgiveness to the
enemy on an individual basis and suggested it should apply as a
general precept for all of the enemy. This opinion is permitted. The
enemy is vulnerable to all standard weaponry and should be terminated
or reassigned to Recycling Duty as prescribed in the Procedures of
Containment.

SCP-2998-C is the enemy. The enemy is the source of all heresy. The
enemy consists of all those remnants of the impure organization that
preceded the Cleansing; any organization or group that rejected the
ascension of the Chaplains upon the fall of They-That-Watch-Over
(secure contain protect us all) are considered part of the enemy. By
writ of the Chaplains, the enemy are divided into two orders:

Those humans that have been exposed directly to the beseechings of the
True Foundation OR transgress within territory contained by the True
Foundation and refuse to accept the secure containment and protection
of the Chaplains. These are Level 2 heretics and are subject to
capture and Recycling Duty without moral forgiveness. Those humans who
are outside the area of North America. No contact with these humans
has been recorded since the Darkening and the likelihood of contact is
low. The High Chaplainry theoretically posits that this group may be
considered enemy or civilian and authorizes any local Chaplain to make
this determination should the situation arise.


A list of specific instances of heretics and their crimes.

Footnotes

1. Okay, guys.

2. Whoever's reading this, listen up. I'm piggybacking off of the
theocrats' network, since it's the most coherent database left around
and they were wiped out last month anyway. Sorry about the garbage.
Have to make some concessions to corruptions in the network. We lost a
hell of a lot of the informational connectivity we used to have, some
from Drone sabotage back in the beginning, some from the Blackout,
some when the Lox landed outright and started hijacking hardwired
communications, some from sabotage and internecine fighting. (Some of
that last part was me, sorry :)) Wherever you are, you all know how
much we've lost. I don't know who all can see this. If you can read
this, please reply with footnotes. It's one of the last features on
Old Foundation networks that's still functional. This is Maria Jones,
Foundation authorization Delta-16516-Epsilon-Charlie. Please talk to
me.

3. Maria? You're still alive? Jesus Christ, how did you get out of 19?
This is David Rosen, FAuth Sigma-50115-Pi-Bravo. Oh, hell, like you
can verify that. I'm hiding out at 62C, Sonoran Desert, and this is
one of the last archival pages I could access. Where are you?

4. David? We were in transit when the Lox got 19. We've been moving
from place to place in California since. I'm with the remnants of a
couple of MTFs, a couple other researchers. Maybe twenty of us. You?

5. I'm hiding in a security substation in the basement. Somebody was
keeping a hell of a lot of rations down here. I can make it probably
two more years here, but I can't make too much noise. They have
physical control of the entire facility. I have access to the computer
systems, though.

6. Can you tell what they're doing up there? I didn't think they were
doing anything except searching for their fugitive. What do they need
to occupy a Site for?

7. I've accessed the security streams and watched them a few times. I
had no idea what the hell I was looking at until I read a couple of
files lying around. This site has a very specific purpose, apparently,
and these guys figured it out too. They're doing containment.

8. Give me a couple of minutes to look this up.

9. I've got the time. Whenever you get back, I have a question, if you
don't mind.

10. Oh, dear God. That 62C? The anomaly's still there? They have Lox
up there monitoring it? Are they doing anything differently?

11. Not Lox. Drones, actually. Everyone I've seen with one exception
is an infected human. The Lox took this Site early, maybe the first
one they took when they came down, but they aren't around much
anymore. They have one Lox guard up there, I think just a supervisor.
But they're following protocol perfectly. There hasn't been any change
in status of the…whatever the hell it is. It's just sitting where it
always has. But what I don't get is why it's still here. Looking
through a lot of video feeds and putting together some of the weirder
intelligence I've picked up on, I think they neutralized all of the
really bad Keter-class that we didn't clean up before Blackout.
I…can't really explain what they did in a lot of cases, because I'm
not sure what it is I was seeing. But Tophet and 231-7 are definitely
off-world, as is 682. They…I think they've accidentally adopted an
entire planet full of anomalies that they'll have to take care of now.
I can't help but think that's pretty damn funny.

12. Not going to argue with you there, David. Okay, listen, I have an
idea. I don't think you have clearance for this file, but see if you
can access "Thaumiel Alpha-2" from where you are. Use my auth code.
Oh, and what's your question?

13. Okay, the file seems to be loading, but it's pretty slow. Oh,
Jesus Christ, I can already tell this is way past my pay grade. Or
would have been, I guess. Anyway, the Lox are supposedly here to get
their fugitive or something, right? Do, um, did we ever find out what
happened with that?

14. Once the document loads, search through it for the phrase "Can't
fit round pegs in square holes." I don't know exactly how the Lox
infection process works once a human is exposed to the signal, but we
had eight D-class escape after Ruhar died, and all eight D-class were
dead within three days. Tracked down by MTFs and killed while trying
to escape. There was no way for us to negotiate our way out of this,
if that's what you're asking.

15. Don't know why it would matter at this point. Just wondering 'what
if', I guess. Anyway, I'm looking at this note. What now?

16. Highlight those words and hit ctrl-alt-enter. Read what comes up.

17. Oh. Ohhhhhh. Shit. Let me go look at the arms locker. Here's
hoping those MREs kept me in decent enough shape to instigate a
containment breach. Is that other SCP even here?

18. I wouldn't ask you to volunteer for this if there was any other
way out. Don't even know if this is a way out. This was just a
theoretical contingency plan. But yes, I have it on good authority
that both were stored at 62C together for a reason. If we hadn't lost
the Site so early, I'm willing to bet we would have activated it by
now. But there sure as hell isn't much left to lose at this point. No
offense.

19. None taken. Not much of a life left. I've got a couple of assault
rifles here and some grenades. I don't think any of the drones are
armed. Pulling up schematics of the Site now. Do you know where 055
is?

20. Look on the schematics for a storage room marked "fifty-five." It
should be pretty close to the subbasement, actually, so you should be
near it. Get it to the primary containment chamber and fit the peg
into the hole.

21. I think I'm ready. Anything else I need to know?

22. Nothing more I can say. Good luck saving the world.

23. Thanks. See you…wherever.

Item #: SCP-2998

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: The Foundation has modified radio
frequency and electronics manufacturing standards worldwide to avoid
civilian production of devices capable of converting SCP-2998 into
audiovisual signals. Internet, radio, and print communications
monitoring efforts by relevant Foundation departments are to be on
alert for images or descriptions relating to SCP-2998. The frequency
on which SCP-2998 is broadcast is to be monitored regularly for any
change in SCP-2998 content. All extraterrestrial vessels and probes
are to be modified covertly to include equipment designed to monitor
for the presence of SCP-2998 off-world. Research to determine the
source of SCP-2998 and the background behind its content is to
continue as a Class 6 priority effort. Research to determine the cause
of and treat or prevent the anomalous effects associated with SCP-2998
exposure is to continue as a Class 6 priority effort.

Description: SCP-2998 is an electromagnetic signal with a constant
frequency of 2485 MHz. Its power and origin cannot be determined; the
signal appears to be invariably present at all locations throughout
the known solar system. The signal seems to lack a single point of
origin, and is for all intents and purposes omnipresent.1 As the
signal has been found to be ubiquitous by every receiver capable of
detecting it both on- and off-Earth, it is presently believed that
SCP-2998 may be broadcasting throughout the universe simultaneously.

The signal itself appears to be an anomalous but innocuous white noise
present at that frequency; minor variances suggest the presence of
some other information within the signal, but no means to discern
comprehensible information from SCP-2998 have yet been developed.
However, Foundation researchers have noted correlations between
exposure of personnel to SCP-2998 in any form perceptible by humans
(including auditory or visual form) and the development of unusual
neurological and psychological symptoms, including paranoia, severe
anxiety, and decreases in thiamine levels in the brain, leading to a
form of sudden-onset Korsakoff's syndrome. This deficiency is said to
explain the amnestic-confabulatory symptoms of SCP-2998 exposure,
which causes individuals determined to be vulnerable to these symptoms
to develop increasingly vivid hallucinations regarding a [DATA
EXPUNGED] abate with reintroduction of thiamine to the diet and have
not yet caused permanent harm to affected individuals.


Addendum 2998-A: As of ██/██/████, little progress has been made in
determining the nature or content of any additional information within
SCP-2998. However, advances in cryptoanalytical techniques and several
breakthroughs in [DATA EXPUNGED] have prompted SCP-2998 researchers to
predict significant development in the decoding of the signal within
the next three months.

1. Current analysis suggests SCP-2998 is being broadcast with a power
of 1.86 mW, which in combination with the large coverage area of
SCP-2998 suggests that the signal is being broadcast from a single
unknown location in a fashion that transcends 4-dimensional space,
emerging into conventional space in a three-dimensional grid pattern
with transmission points spaced approximately three meters apart in
Euclidean space.
