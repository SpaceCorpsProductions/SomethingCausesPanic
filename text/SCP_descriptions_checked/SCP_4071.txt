Item #: SCP-4071 

Object Class: Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: Foundation web crawlers are to monitor the 
internet for reports of inconsistencies between documented events and human 
memories. Any documentation determined to be a SCP-4071-2 instance is to be 
immediately removed from circulation. Depending on the extent of the presence of 
SCP-4071-1 in each SCP-4071-2 instance, and how widely spread it has been, a new 
copy of the documentation without content of SCP-4071-1 instances may be created 
to replace the SCP-4071-2 instances. 

If any previously unrecorded SCP-4071-1 instances are detected, any potentially 
affected documentation is to be examined in order to determine whether they have 
become SCP-4071-2. Any individuals who witness a SCP-4071-2 instance are to be 
amnesticised, and/or publicly discredited, depending on the circumstances. 

Description: SCP-4071 is a phenomenon in which previously unrecorded events 
simultaneously appear in a large number of various forms of documentation. These 
include but are not limited to journal articles, news reports, documentaries, 
some fiction, and textbooks. SCP-4071-1-X refers to each unrecorded event. 
SCP-4071-2-X-X refers to each piece of documentation affected. 

The Foundation became aware of this situation due to a sudden exponential 
increase in reports of documentation not supported by human memory. Further 
examination has found that a number of previously unrecorded events have 
suddenly appeared in various forms of documentation. 

Based on the type of information appearing in documentation, it is the 
Foundation’s belief that this anomaly is being directed by an individual or 
group of people attempting to increase global tension. As a result, groups such 
as the Chaos Insurgency, the Organisation for the Reclamation of Islamic 
Artifacts and the Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency are to 
be investigated. 


- Addendum 

The following is a list of documented events confirmed to be SCP-4071-1 
instances. The changes in human behaviour indicate the differences between 
reality and the documented SCP-4071-1 instances. 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0007 

Date of SCP-4071-1-0007: 09/07/2018 

Material most affected: Widespread among all forms of media; news related media 
including articles and videos most affected. 

Description of SCP-4071-1-0007: The division of Korea into two separate 
countries, the Republic of Korea, or South Korea, and the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea, or North Korea. 

Changes in human behaviour: The population of North Korea are repressed and 
nuclear-weapon oriented, while the population of South Korea are technologically 
focused. 


Designation: SCP-4071-1-0149 

Date of SCP-4071-1-0049: 09/10/2018 

Material most affected: Video game magazines, online videos, online forums. 

Description of SCP-4071-1-0149: The invention of an extremely popular console 
called Xbox, developed by Microsoft. 

Changes in human behaviour: Creators are offered incentives to exclusively 
produce content for either Xbox or PlayStation. PlayStation controllers are no 
longer supported by Microsoft computers due to brand loyalty. 


Designation: SCP-4071-1-0421 

Date of SCP-4071-1-0421: 29/10/2018 

Material most affected: Council permits, rental agreements, architectural plans. 

Description of SCP-4071-1-0421: The construction of a large block of apartments 
at 900 Biscayne Bay, Miami. 

Changes in human behaviour: Several hundred people apparently believe they 
previously resided in 900 Biscayne Bay.

SCP-4071

Item #: SCP-4071

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: Foundation web crawlers are to monitor
the internet for reports of inconsistencies between documented events
and human memory. Any documentation which mentions a SCP-4071-1
instance is to be immediately removed from circulation. Depending on
the extent of the presence of SCP-4071-1 in each affected
documentation, and how widely spread it has been, a new copy of the
documentation may be created to replace the SCP-4071-2 instances.

Task Force History Buffs has been formed, comprising of several
hundred individuals with extremely high scores on memory tests. The
members of this group are not to be allowed any unsupervised contact
with any other individual. They are not to be given access to any
communication device. This position is strictly voluntary. Each member
is to be assigned a selection of documentation for all known SCPs,
sites, MTF groups, GoIs, ongoing operations, and any other Foundation
information. Each day, they are to check their documentation to ensure
that no information has been lost. Any discrepancy between memory and
documentation is to be immediately reported to all involved personnel.

Description: SCP-4071 is a phenomenon in which events simultaneously
disappear from the memories of the entire human population. While
individuals can reacquire memories of the events through reading
documentation, there appears to be a moderate disposition towards
considering the documentation untrustworthy. This has resulted in
significant changes in reality even when documentation contradicting
human memory is wide-spread and readily available.

SCP-4071-1 refers to the events that have been expunged from human
memory. While these events initially tended to be concerned with
political situations, they have become increasingly random over time.

SCP-4071-2 refers to The Anti-Recall System, the computer program by
which this phenomenon was initially created. Each event inputted into
the program is instantly and simultaneously removed from the memories
of all human beings. Although this was initially the sole method of
which memories could be removed, SCP-4071 has since become an unstable
and unpredictable phenomenon, with events being removed from memory
seemingly at complete random.

While the Manna Charitable Foundation has ceased using SCP-4071-2
since becoming aware of this, SCP-4071-1 have continues to occur at a
steadily increasing rate. It is predicted that all human memories will
be completely removed within approximately thirty years. However, the
Foundation is currently unable to confidently identify the exact
number of SCP-4071-1 events are occurring. This, combined with the
unpredictability of which memories will be removed, makes it extremely
likely that the maximum span of time is less than this. This is
particularly the case if memories vital to survival are removed from
human knowledge.


- Interview 4071-1

Interviewed: Mrs Laura Wessex, Executive Director of the Manna
Charitable Foundation

Interviewer: Agent Mary Fields

Foreword: Mrs Wessex approached Foundation personnel claiming that
they had vital knowledge of an SCP currently causing an CK-class
restructuring scenario.

<Begin Log>

Agent Fields: I’m Agent Mary Fields. I’ve been informed that you have
something important that you believe that the Foundation needs to be
aware of..

Mrs Wessex: Yes. Normally we – I – wouldn’t approach the Foundation,
but this has gotten bigger than we can handle.

Agent Fields: “We?” Could you please tell me who you are, and who else
you are referring to?

Mrs Wessex: Right, yes. I’m Mrs Laura Wessex. I’m the Executive
Director of the Manna Charitable Foundation.

Agent Fields: And what is this CK-class restructuring scenario that
you wanted to inform the Foundation about?

Mrs Wessex: History as we know it is being removed from the memory of
every human being on this earth.

Agent Fields: That’s… Quite a claim. How is it that this is happening?

Mrs Wessex: A few months ago, we were approached by an individual
offering us a donation. It was a computer. The only thing on this
computer was a program called The Anti-Recall System. We were told
that it would allow us to remove the memories of any event we chose
from every human being on earth.

Agent Fields: I assume that your group saw this opportunity and leapt
at it?

Mrs Wessex: [Laughs bitterly] Of course we did! This could end every
instance of conflict simply by inputting information into a computer
program.. From grudges between countries right down to the individual
level, if need be. We were suddenly able to make the world a safer
place. Of course we used it.

Agent Fields: I take it this is why there’s recently been a
discrepancy between documentation and human memory?

Mrs Wessex: Yes. We didn’t think… We didn’t realise that this only
affected memory, nothing else. But even when we did, it was still
worth it, especially since we knew that you would clean up after us.

Agent Fields: Well then. If everything is going to your plan, why are
you here, then?

Mrs Wessex: That’s just it. For the first month or so, it was all
fine. With each event we removed, people put down their weapons, and
corruption seemed to vanish overnight. Sure, there were a few bumps
along the way, but even so, the world was getting better. However, we
soon realised that events we hadn’t selected were also being removed.

Agent Fields: Like what?

Mrs Wessex: There was no rhyme and reason to them! Some of them were
trivial, like a monarch being crowned centuries ago, while others were
devastating, like the construction of a residential skyscraper!

Agent Fields: So that’s when you decided to come to us, huh? Weeks
after you realised that you’d instigated an CK-class restructuring
scenario?

Mrs Wessex: You know why we couldn’t come to you. The Foundation would
have taken it away from us, tried to reverse all the good we did. So
instead we stopped using it. For a while we thought it had worked… But
soon we realised the extent of our problems, and, well, here I am.

Agent Fields: Do you have anything else to add?

Mrs Wessex: No. Yes. Please, don’t undo the good we did. We screwed
up, but we also ended a lot of long-standing conflict. Please…

Agent Fields: You know that’s not possible.

Mrs Wessex: We only wanted to help. It’s up to you to decide whether
our efforts will make the world a better place, or whether they were
all for nothing.

<End Log>

Closing Statement: Mrs Wessex was able to provide detailed records of
every SCP-4071-1 event that the Manna Charitable Foundation caused,
confirming her story.


- Addendum 4071-2

The following is a list of events that Mrs Wessex has confirmed that
have been intentionally removed from human memory by the Manna
Charitable Foundation.

Designation: SCP-4071-0000001 to SCP-4071-0005034

Date of event: 09/07/2018

Description of event: The events both preceding and following the
division of Korea into the Republic of Korea, or South Korea, and the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or North Korea.

Changes in human behaviour:

South Korea and North Korea have merged into one country named Korea,
and elected a new government.

The Korean government immediately ordered that the Korean Wall along
the demilitarized zone be dismantled.

An outpouring of aid from ex-South Korea into ex-North Korea has taken
place, both from individual citizens and the new government of Korea.

Ex-North Korean citizens have begun to be introduced to life outside
their country, such as Western culture that has not been tainted by
propaganda.

There are some indications of growing resentment in Korea. Ex-South
Koreans are unhappy at the sudden increase in welfare which has raised
taxes. Ex-North Koreans are unhappy at the disparity in wealth between
themselves and ex-South Koreans.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0005035 to SCP-4071-1-0007986

Date of event: 09/07/2018

Description of event: The events both preceding and during the Syrian
Civil War.

Changes in human behaviour:

All military groups in the Syrian Arab Republic immediately disband.

The Manna Charitable Foundation and other similar organisations
provide aid in the form of food, water, medical care, rebuilding
destroyed buildings, and care for orphaned children.

The US and Russia attempt to aid in a new election in Syria. Both
countries accuse the other of interfering in Syrian interests for
their own gain.

The new Syrian president is declared to have Russian interests at
heart by the US, sparking concerns of another civil war.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0007987 to SCP-4071-1-0009510

Date of event: 09/07/2018

Description of event: The events both preceding and during the South
Sudanese Civil War.

Changes in human behaviour:

All military groups in the South Sudan immediately disband.

The Manna Charitable Foundation and other similar organisations
provide aid, with a particular focus on rehabilitation programs for
ex-child soldiers.

Many former adult soldiers are faced with no work, no pay, and no
experience outside of fighting in a militia. As a result, there is a
massive outbreak of violent crime in South Sudan.

A proposal to create a new police force from ex-militia members is
rejected in favour of international military soldiers from the USA,
Britain and Australia.

Deep unrest is growing in South Sudan due to the sudden influx of
foreign soldiers.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0009511 to SCP-4071-1-0010760

Date of event: 06/08/2018

Description of event: The events both preceding and following the
election of Emomali Rahmon as President of Tajikistan

Changes in human behaviour:

There are no significant changes in the corruption index of the Tajiki
government.

The position of President has been amended to be that of President for
Life.

Non-Islamic individuals have been forced to flee the country or face
prosecution.

Reports of child labour have dramatically increased.

The number of individuals being smuggled out of the country for the
sex trade is highest on record, and rising.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0010761 to SCP-4071-1-0011402

Date of event: 13/08/2018

Description of event: The events preceding and following the election
of Saparmurat Niyazov as the President for Life of Turkmenistan.

Changes in human behaviour:

The new president, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, institutes a number of
policies that encourage human rights to be given more importance.

The cultural mindset changes, which results in major decreases of
racial discrimination, particularly against Russians.

Niyazov’s book of spiritual writings is no longer considered to be an
important religious text.

Religious freedom and freedom of expression are beginning to be
implemented.

While some individuals disagree with the direction that Turkmenistan
is taking, the majority of the country support and often actively
implement these changes.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0011403 to SCP-4071-1-0012948

Date of event: 20/08/2018

Description of event: The events preceding, during, and following the
presidency of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela.

Changes in human behaviour:

The suspension of constitutional rights in Venezuela has been lifted.

New elections have been held.

Living conditions in Venezuela have slowly begun to rise.

Due to the incredibly high crime rate, particularly in regards to
murder and kidnapping, the military has been redeployed as a
peace-keeping force in Venezuela.

The new president was overthrown by a military coup. The country is
now under military rule.

Living conditions return to pre-SCP-4071 levels.

The border of Venezuela has been closed. This has ostensibly been done
in order to protect the citizens from foreign invasion. However, many
countries and organisations believe that it has been implemented in
order to give the military time to consolidate power.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0012949 to SCP-4071-1-0013277

Date of event: 27/08/2018

Description of event: The events preceding and during the Yemeni Civil
War.

Changes in human behaviour:

After several weeks, Yemen is once more embroiled in a civil war,
albeit one that appears to be less widespread and vicious than it was
prior to SCP-4071.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0013278 to SCP-4071-1-0019821

Date of event: 03/09/2018

Description of event: The 1998 journal article that first posited a
connection between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine,
and all subsequent events.

Changes in human behaviour:

Vaccination rates in first-world countries experience a significant
increase.

New surveys find that fear of side effects now makes up an extremely
small percentage of the answers of those who do not vaccinate their
children or themselves.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0019822 to SCP-4071-1-0027444

Date of event: 10/09/2018

Description of event: The events preceding and following the creation
of the Taliban and ISIS.

Changes in human behaviour:

Foreign troops are slowly but surely decreased in Afghanistan as the
country becomes increasingly stable.

Countries reduce their foreign aid expenses as the demand lessens, but
this does leave some particularly vulnerable individuals without aid.

The drug trade increases as people previously involved in war turn to
other profitable avenues.

A proposal to allow all girls to attend school has been introduced,
and will likely pass.

 
Designation: SCP-4071-1-0027445 to SCP-4071-1-0028009

Date of event: 17/09/2018

Description of event: The events of, preceding, and following the
reduction of foreign aid expenditure in the budgets of numerous
countries.

Changes in human behaviour:

Global increases in foreign aid expenditure.

Decreases in various other areas in budgets, including but not limited
to military expenditure, education, and welfare.
 

Designation: SCP-4071-1-0028010 to SCP-4071-1-0028975

Date of event: 24/09/2018

Description of event: The events preceding and following the election
of every politician in the Republic of Haiti.

Changes in human behaviour:

The country is initially thrown into chaos. The US attempts to help
facilitate a new election, but the local populace’s outrage is such
that they withdraw.

The government is reorganised into a direct democracy.1

A complex system of electronic voting systems is set up in order to
allow Haiti’s citizens to vote on a single common issue each day.

- Addendum 4071-4

To whom it may concern,

As per our decision to keep all information on SCP-4071 in writing in
case of a SCP-4071-1 instance removing important knowledge, I am
sending this update via email as well as in person.

As we all know, SCP-4071 is a CK-class restructuring scenario which,
if we don’t act to prevent, will eventually turn into an XK-class
end-of-the-world scenario. As a result, we have numerous people
working around the clock to attempt to engineer a way to reverse
SCP-4071, or at least halt the emergence of new SCP-4071-1 instances.

Currently, the most promising avenue is an imagery-based countermeme
that the Memetics and Infohazards Division is working on. The aim of
this countermeme is to make people completely immune to new SCP-4071-1
instances. Ideally, it would also allow individuals to regain memories
that SCP-4071 has caused them to lose. However, we believe that it
will require direct exposure to an individual in order for it to be
effective. If this countermeme does prove successful, we should expect
a logistical nightmare to expose the global population to this
countermeme.

Indeed, even if the countermeme is successful, the Foundation will
still have a considerable task on its hands in order to return the
world to baseline history. We need to start considering a how to
achieve this. The current proposal is for the Foundation, in
collaboration with many other organisations and governments, to remove
all traces of the past several months. Once this has been achieved, we
would amesticise the global population to match this. Once we find an
effective countermeme, we will begin to formulate more in-depth plans.
Until then, we can only hope that nothing important becomes an
SCP-4071-1 instance.

Regards,

Dr Michael Pearson

Head of the SCP-4071 Department



Footnotes

1. A form of government in which every citizen votes directly on
issues, rather than for politicians to represent them.



NEXT ITERATION


SCP-4071

Item #: SCP-4071

Object Class: Neutralised

Special Containment Procedures: Foundation web crawlers are to monitor
the internet for reports of inconsistencies between documented events
and human memory. Any potential SCP-4071-1 instances are to
immediately be reported to Dr Michael Person, head of the SCP-4071
Department.

Any documentation which mentions a SCP-4071-1 instance is to be
immediately removed from circulation. Depending on the extent of the
presence of SCP-4071-1 in each affected documentation, and how widely
spread it has been, a new copy of the documentation may be created to
replace the SCP-4071-2 instances.

The Foundation is to also monitor news outlets and similar sources of
information for reports of individuals or groups of people with
significant gaps in their knowledge of past events, with a particular
emphasis on those who have been in remote areas. Foundation agents are
to immediately proceed to their vicinity and expose them to the
countermeme for SCP-4071. If the countermeme does not reverse this
discrepancy between memory and history, they are to be taken into
Foundation custody to determine whether they are being affected by
SCP-4071. If they are determined to be affected by SCP-4071, the
Foundation is to immediately begin work on a new countermeme.

Description: SCP-4071 is a phenomenon in which events simultaneously
disappear from common memory. SCP-4071-1 refers to the events that
have been expunged from memory. As of the time of writing, SCP-4071 is
believed to be neutralised, with 97.83% of the human population having
been successfully exposed to the countermeme.

For a number of months after the successful development of the
countermeme, the Foundation, a number of governments, and several
organisations began working to reverse the physical effects on the
world that occurred while SCP-4071 was active. Documentation created
in that time was destroyed, and that which was edited or destroyed by
the Foundation was replaced by copies of the original text. Any
physical changes such as construction work, natural disasters and
moving homes have been reverted. On 04/07/2019, exactly one year minus
a day after the first SCP-4071-1 instance was created, the global
population was amnesticised, and the past year effectively erased.
