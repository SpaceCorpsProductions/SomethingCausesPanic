Item #: SCP-1825 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1825 is to be contained in a 5 m x 5 m x 
3 m storage room. Testing with SCP-1825 is recommended to take place inside a 
10 m x 34 m x 3 m rectangular room composed of reinforced steel, and must be 
authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-1825 is only allowed to be 
removed from storage for testing purposes, and is not to be activated outside, 
or inside a spherical room <See Addendum-1825-01-A>. 

Description: SCP-1825 is a blue pinball machine measuring 2 m x 50 cm x 
1.7 m. SCP-1825 features an empty playing field, with two flippers on the 
bottom, and a hatch for a ball to enter at the top, a scoreboard, and a plunger. 
Currently, the highest score is 30,232,450 <See Test Log-1825-01-11>, which has 
been recorded on SCP-1825's scoreboard. 

When SCP-1825 is activated, all entities in the room are restrained from below 
their waist by an unseen force, making movement impossible. The subject who 
activated SCP-1825 is not affected, and is able move freely. When the subject 
pulls SCP-1825's handle, the hatch will release one metal ball that, once hit by 
a flipper, will create an invisible force in the room whose movement reflects 
how the ball moves on SCP-1825's playing field. 

When this force collides with a wall, subject, or object in the room, the item 
hit will be variably damaged from the collision while retaining its position and 
approximate shape from the time of activation. When the subject is hit, 
[REDACTED], which results in the subject's upper half disconnecting from their 
waist, while their lower half remains supported. Objects unaffected from this 
force are SCP-1825, the subject who pulled the plunger, and any objects and 
persons entering the room after activation. When the ball returns to the drain, 
everything that was affected ceases to be supported by SCP-1825, and collapses 
if it was damaged significantly. 

The weight and density of the force created from SCP-1825 increases with the 
number of points on the scoreboard, which allows the ball to start at an 
estimated one kg per square meter, and theoretically increase to 999,999,999 kg 
per cubic meters when the scoreboard has reached its limit. Due to SCP-1825 
providing only one ball, and the extensive damage that would ensue, this has yet 
to be achieved. 

Recovery Notes: SCP-1825 was found after an incident on 01/██/20██, 
where an abandoned arcade game factory in ████████ collapsed. 
One body was found in the area, ███████ ████, a vagrant 
presumably seeking shelter inside the factory. It is assumed that 
███████ ████ activated SCP-1825, and died from the debris 
created from leveling the building. SCP-1825 was found in the wreckage, 
protected from the debris by several steel girders. Due to the proximity of 
recovery to SCP-142, investigation into the potential for a shared origin 
between the two objects is currently ongoing. 


Addendum 1825: Testing Log: 

Test Log-1825-01 

Forward: All testing rooms used with SCP-1825 are to have walls
composed of reinforced steel in order to prevent an incident similar
to the one prior to containment.

Test Number: 1

Subject: D-1825-1

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 7:00 AM

Test: place SCP-1825 inside a empty 10 m x 34 m x 3 m room and use
SCP-1825 normally.

Result: Banging could be heard against the walls whenever D-1825-1 had
the ball hit the side of the playing field. Test was otherwise
uneventful.


Test Number: 2

Subject: D-1825-1

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 7:14 AM

Test: SCP-1825 is to be used inside the previous room, with a large
table placed in the center.

Result: When the ball hit the space approximately located to the table
on the playing field, SCP-1825 interpreted the table as a bumper. As
D-1825-1 hit the table, the force increased in density, and eventually
made large dents in the walls. Once the table was hit twice, the table
was damaged, reaching a score of ten before collision. Once the ball
fell into the drain, the table immediately collapsed.


Test Number: 3

Subject: D-1825-1 and D-1825-2

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 8:09 AM

Test: SCP-1825 is used inside the room with an additional D-class
inside (D-1825-2).

Result: D-1825-2 immediately expressed discomfort once SCP-1825 was
activated, reporting an inability to move his legs. After each
collision with D-1825-2, the score increased by ten points. When hit
for the fourth time, reaching a score of 30 beforehand, D-1825-2's
torso disconnected from the lower half of his body, and landed on the
floor while the lower half of his body was supported. D-1825-1
immediately let go of SCP-1825, and backed away. When the ball went
down the drain, D-1825-2's lower half was released, and fell to the
ground.


Test Number: 4

Subjects: D-1825-1

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 9:30 PM

Test: Activate SCP-1825 in a rectangular room that measures 10 m x 34
m x 3 m, with one hole in the floor, measuring two meters in diameter.
D-1825-1 is to use SCP-1825 normally.

Result: Once the hole was hit, SCP-1825 interpreted it as a Kickout
hole and the scoreboard gained fifty points. The force was then
ejected towards the wall at a speed of approximately 72.4 kph. A large
hole in the wall was left after the collision, measuring 2 meters in
diameter. The test was terminated immediately afterwards.


Test Number: 5

Subject: D-1825-1

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 9:40 AM

Test: SCP-1825 is used inside a 11 m x 11 m x 4 m room. Walls are
equipped with motion sensors to check for any distortion in the force
created by SCP-1825.

Result: When activated, SCP-1825 emitted a series of noises commonly
heard from a standard pinball machine before allowing the ball to be
deployed. When hit, the force was distorted to the shape of an oval,
which caused the ball inside SCP-1825 to curve away from its typical
projection.


Test Number: 6

Subject: D-1825-1

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 9:50 AM

Test: SCP-1825 is used inside a three-walled room with each wall
measuring 11 meters, and a height of 4 meters. Walls are equipped with
motion sensors to check for any distortion in the force.

Result: When activated, SCP-1825 emitted a series of noises <see test
log-1825-01-A-4>. Afterwards, D-1825-1 was able to use SCP-1825;
however, the force seemed to vary in width as it moved across the
playing field.


Test Number: 7

Subject: D-1825-1

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 10:00 AM

Test: SCP-1825 is used inside a cylindrical room with a diameter
measuring 11 meters, and a height of 4 meters. Walls are equipped with
motion sensors to check for any distortion in the force.

Result: When activated, SCP-1825 emitted an identical series of noises
like in test four and five, and D-1825-1 was able to use SCP-1825,
however, the balls course has become unpredictable, and often bounces
to hit the glass.


Test Number: 8

Subject:D-1825-1

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 10:10 AM

Test: Use SCP-1825 in a spherical room that has a diameter of twelve
meters. Walls are equipped with motion sensors to check for any
distortion in the force.

Result: When activated, SCP-1825 emitted a series of pings before
letting D-1825-1 pull the plunger, although louder and longer than
those observed in tests 5, 6, and 7.When the ball hit the flipper, the
room immediately broke off from the rest of the building, and launched
itself northwest for approximately 500 meters outside. The room fell
three stories once brought outside, and returned to the building. The
ball stopped when it lightly hit the side of the site, leaving minimal
damage to the first floor. When the inside of the room was examined,
blood covered approximately 30% of the interior. SCP-1825 was found on
its side, with the left hind leg bent from D-1825-1 colliding with it,
and the words "tilt" displayed across its score board. Aside from
this, SCP-1825 was otherwise undamaged. Collateral damage includes one
empty office, part of a hallway, one janitorial closet and two
bathrooms, plus one D-class personnel.

Notes: SCP-1825 needs to be cleaned of blood, have its leg fixed, and
moved to its original containment immediately. It appears that when
placed inside a spherical room, SCP-1825 cannot identify the room as a
playing field, so in an attempt to start the game, SCP-1825 interprets
its surroundings into something it can work with. Dr.T██


Test Number: 9

Subjects: D-1825-3-23; twenty one D-Class personnel

Time: February 2nd, 20██, 4:02 PM

Test: Activate SCP-1825 in a rectangular room that measures 10m x 34m
x 3m, and let eighteen D-class personnel in the same room during
activation. D-1825-3 is to simply activate SCP-1825, and is told not
pull the plunger. One minute after activation, D-1825-22 and D-1825-23
are told to go inside and walk around.

Result: D-1825-4 through 21 were prevented from moving, as expected.
When D-1825-22 and D-1825-23 were told to go inside, they were allowed
to move freely. When D-1825-22 and D-1825-23 were instructed to try
and move SCP-1825, D-1825-22 and D-1825-23 were unsuccessful. Once
SCP-1825 was turned off, D-1825-22 and D-1825-23 were able to lift
SCP-1825.

Notes: Using SCP-1825 as a means of containment for D-class personnel
has been considered, and denied due to obvious destructive properties
SCP-1825 possesses. This test would also explain how SCP-1825 remained
intact during test number seven.

Test Number: 11

Subject: D-1825-3

Time: February 3rd, 20██, 11:25 AM

Test: Keep SCP-1825 in the same rectangular room. Tell D-1825-3 to
line the entire room with the given furniture so it blocks the ball
from going inside the drain.

Result: As soon as D-1825-3 hit the ball with the plunger, the ball
kept bouncing around inside the ring of furniture. The ball has become
trapped in an endless loop, and presumably refuses to turn off until
the ball returns to the drain.



Test Number: 11.1

Subject: D-1825-3

Time: February 3rd, 20██, 11:34 AM

Test: Give D-1825-3 a set of tools, and tell her to try and remove the
glass. Once done, D-1825-3 is asked to try and touch the furniture
from SCP-1825, and put the ball back in the drain.

Result: D-1825-3 successfully removed the glass, and confirmed that
she could feel the furniture, although no further damage was taken
from this action. When the ball was lifted up, the force burst through
the ceiling. D-1825-3 panicked, and shoved the ball into the drain,
which created a large hole in the area. When the game was ended, the
score was 30,232,450, and has been recorded as the high score by
SCP-1825.

Notes: These results explains that the ball is what causes damage, not
the machine. This would open up a possibility for military use, but
since it’s the only one, it's best if we didn't use SCP-1825 in a
situation where it could be damaged further.

Dr. T██


Test Number: 12

Subject: D-1825-3

Time: February 3rd, 20██, 1:44 PM

Test: SCP-1825 is to be outside with a truck placed 25 meters in front
of it. D-1825-3 is asked to take the ball out before hitting it with
the flipper, and feel around for an object shaped like a truck in
SCP-1825’s playing field. If D-1825-3 finds it, she is then tasked to
hit it with the ball.

Result: [TEST ABORTED]

Notes: Since there's the high probability that SCP-1825 would not
comprehend an outside playing field, and turn [REDACTED] into the
pinball, I stopped the test. I recommend that we cease further testing
with SCP-1825, and have it remain in storage until further notice.

Addendum 1825-01-A:

Dr. T██s statements have been noted. Tests held inside a spherical
room or outside involving SCP-1825 will be denied.
