Item #: SCP-2343 

Object Class: Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2343 is to be housed in a modified humanoid 
containment cell at Site-88. SCP-2343's containment cell is to utilize 7 active 
Scranton Reality Anchors with overlapping areas of effect, along with 4 
Non-Physical Displacement Neutralizers. These devices are to utilize triply 
redundant power backups. 

14 inactive Scranton Reality Anchors and 8 Non-Physical Displacement 
Neutralizers are to be kept in good repair at Site-88 at all times for use 
exclusively with SCP-2343. If any of the active reality anchors or displacement 
neutralizers should fail, inactive backups kept onsite shall be utilized until 
the primary devices are either repaired or replaced. 

A copy of these containment procedures shall be kept on file at Site-88, 
Site-19, and Site-17 and are to be stored within their own Scranton Reality 
Anchor fields. Once per day, those documents are to be compared with this 
document for any discrepancies. A discrepancy between any of these documents 
should be reported to SCP-2343's project director and Site-88's Director. 

Description: SCP-2343 is a humanoid entity roughly 2.1 meters tall and weighing 
72Â kg. SCP-2343 is capable of voluntary reality restructuring and is considered 
a Class IV reality altering entity. Though SCP-2343 is not actively hostile it 
has made several escape attempts in the past decade. 

SCP-2343 appears as an individual in his late 50s or early 60s. Despite this 
apparent age, SCP-2343 has displayed a physical fitness roughly analogous to an 
individual in his early 20s. SCP-2343 has not shown any signs of aging since 
confinement in 2005. 

In 2005, police were called to a domestic disturbance in Germantown, Tennessee1. 
Once on site, the police gave conflicting reports relating to the subject of the 
complaint. An individual identifying as Peter Panepi made several claims as to 
his abilities while at the same time suffering from the signs of a physical 
assault. 

While the responding officers eventually took the subject into custody due to 
public intoxication, embedded Foundation assets relayed the claims of the 
subject. A routine interview with the subject was scheduled by Foundation assets 
on August 4th, 2005. 


Pre-Recovery Interview 

Date and Time: August 4th, 2005 at 13:04 

Interviewer: Agent Goodman 

Subject: POI-5602 (Later classified as SCP-2343) 

Location: Holding Room B of the Germantown Police Department. 

Transcript: 

Agent Goodman: Hello. You're Peter, right? 

POI-5602: Yeah. Look I'm sorry about the mix up. 

Agent Goodman: Which mix up? 

POI-5602: My wife. I changed my mind, I don't wanna file charges. That was the 
bourbon talkin'. 

Agent Goodman: I'll make sure the officers are aware of that. I'm actually your 
assigned psychologist. I'm here to discuss some of the other claims you made 
while intoxicated. 

POI-5602: Right. You smoke? 

POI-5602 offers Agent Goodman a cigarette. 

Agent Goodman: No, I'm trying to quit. 

POI-5602: I ought to. 

POI-5602 uses a lighter to light his cigarette, and smokes it throughout the 
remainder of the interview. 

POI-5602: Anyway, I get a little mouthy when I'm drunk. I think they said I 
threatened to take the life of the world or some bullshit. 

Agent Goodman: Yes. You also made some claims about your wife as well? 

POI-5602: She doesn't hit me. 

Subject points to bruises on face. 

POI-5602: I got drunk and got into a fight with a friend. 

Agent Goodman: Alright. That's enough for now. 

POI-5602: My wife's probably worried sick. You know when they're letting me out? 

Agent Goodman: I don't think it'll be very long. 

POI-5602: Thanks. 

Subject was searched prior to and following the interview. Neither cigarettes 
nor a lighter were found in either of these searches. A reality anchor was 
requisitioned and deployed from a nearby Foundation garrison to prevent further 
minor actualization incidents. However, once it became apparent to SCP-2343 that 
it was not being released, further moderate actualization incidents occurred. 
Escape by the entity was achieved on August 7th. 

The Foundation, however, in preparing for the possibility of escape, had created 
several reality anchored zones in and around Memphis, Tennessee, including the 
subject's place of work and home. Several failed capture attempts indicated a 
minimum of 3 overlapping reality anchors were required to suppress SCP-2343's 
natural abilities. Capture, transportation and storage of SCP-2343 at Site-88 
was completed on September 9th, 2005. 

Capture of SCP-2343's immediate family, including the object's wife2 was not 
achieved during this time. Acquiring SCP-2343's cooperation in the capture of 
its wife3 is a top priority.

Item #: SCP-2343

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2343 is to be housed in a modified
humanoid containment cell at Site-88. SCP-2343's containment cell is
to utilize an active Scranton Reality Anchor with a redundant power
backup.

A copy of these containment procedures shall be kept on file at
Site-88 and Site-19. Once a day those documents are to be compared
with this document for any discrepancies. A discrepancy between any
copy of these containment procedures should be reported to SCP-2343's
project director.

weighing 62 kg. SCP-2343 is considered a Class I reality altering
entity. SCP-2343 is not actively hostile.

Interviewer: Agent Goodman

Subject: POI-5602 (Later classified as SCP-2343)

Location: Holding Room C of the Germantown Police Department.

Transcript:

Agent Goodman: Hello. I'm your court appointed psychologist.

POI-5602: Right. You smoke?

POI-5602 politely offers Agent Goodman a cigarette.

Agent Goodman: I'm trying to quit.

POI-5602 uses a lighter to light his cigarette, and smokes it
throughout the remainder of the interview.

POI-5602: Look, I get a little mouthy when I'm drunk. I think they
said I threatened to unmake the world or something.

Agent Goodman: Yes. You made some claims about your wife as well?

POI-5602: She's a hellcat. Half the time she don't know what she's
doing.

Agent Goodman: What led to the incident that made you call 911?

POI-5602: Honestly, I don't even remember. I was drunk, I was playing
my guitar and she didn't like it. You ever heard of Tom T. Hall?

Agent Goodman: I haven't.

POI-5602 produces a guitar from under the table and begins to tune it.

Agent Goodman: Where did that come from?

POI-5602: The guards here know I play a little, so they get me a
guitar whenever I'm locked up. You got time to listen to a song?

Agent Goodman: I don't, actually. I have a couple of other prisoners
to talk to today. But I will be back by before the end of the day.

POI-5602: Alright then. Don't be a stranger.

- That's How I Got To Memphis

Item #: SCP-2343

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2343 is to be contained in a

object's voluntary containment, the continued cooperation of SCP-2343
is a top priority.1

weighing 62 kg. SCP-2343 is not actively hostile. SCP-2343 displays a
physical fitness roughly analogous to an individual in his early 20s.

Police were called to a domestic disturbance in Germantown, Tennessee2
in 2005. Once on site, the police gave conflicting reports relating to
the subject of the complaint. An individual identifying as Peter
Panepi was taken into custody. Subject was transferred to Foundation
custody on September 5th.

- Listen up you sideways assholes

I know you'll notice this before the end of the day, so pass it up the
chain.

You folk spend your entire lives worried about what you've got locked
up. But it ain't what's on the inside that's going to get you. It's
what's still outside. You know how my wife used to knock me around?
I've been taking it for a few thousand years so the rest of you
ungrateful assholes could build something. If she finds out I'm down
here, if she finds out what you done, she won't stop until the whole
damn world is drownin' in blood. She done it before, and she'll do it
again.

But y'all ain't gonna let me out. That's fine. Was my own pride got me
in this mess anyway. I'll help you find her, and you can lock her up
like you locked me up. Elsewise y'all die and I'm left to make the
world all over again from the ashes. I'm old, I'm tired, and I don't
know if I got another run left in me. This's what I'm offerin'. Take
it or leave it.
