Item #: SCP-2400 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2400 is contained on-site at Site-59, which 
has been constructed around the anomaly. Only personnel with 4/2400 Clearance 
are permitted to access SCP-2400's containment chamber.

Object Class: Thaumiel 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2400 must remain open when SCP-2400-A is not 
in use. Use of SCP-2400-A (and by extension, Site-64T) requires approval from 
the Site-59 Director (currently Dr. Charles Anborough) and the attached Temporal 
Anomalies Adviser (currently Dr. Thaddeus Xyank). While SCP-2400-A is in use, 
the Site-64T supervisor must submit weekly reports to the Site-59 Director, 
which, due to SCP-2400-A's properties, should be received every sixty-three (63) 
minutes. Non-D-Class personnel assigned to Site-64T should be chosen from 
unmarried individuals, preferably with no living family. Individuals with 
suicidal psychopathology are also preferred. Due to the nature of SCP-2400-A's 
effects on its inhabitants, personnel assigned to Site-64T are to be declared 
legally dead, with appropriate Foundation benefits paid to their family. 

Personnel maintaining residency in SCP-2400-A past the expiration of their 
assignment is forbidden. Travelling further than 100 meters past the perimeter 
of Site-64T is also forbidden, barring SCP-2400-A reconnaissance missions. Any 
anomalous activity occurring in SCP-2400-A that is outstanding from the area's 
established properties must be reported to Site-59 immediately. 

At all times, four (4) demolition charges must be positioned adjacent to 
SCP-2400, two (2) on Site-59's side and two (2) on Site-64T's side. In the event 
of anomalous activity occurring within SCP-2400-A which endangers Site-59, these 
charges are to be detonated. 

Access to the Site-64T Generator Room (Room 128-E) is forbidden barring approval 
from the Site-59 Director (see Addendum [2400-001] for details). 

Description: SCP-2400 is a plain steel door inset on a fragment of concrete 
wall. The wall fragment is irregularly-shaped and roughly 3.71m x 2.25m, while 
the door is 0.65m x 0.91m. The origin of SCP-2400 is unclear. 

When SCP-2400 is open, it functions as a space-time aperture to an area now 
designated SCP-2400-A. A second instance of SCP-2400 is present in SCP-2400-A, 
and is the only object on an otherwise featureless horizontal plane. The size of 
SCP-2400-A is undetermined, and by all accounts, appears to be a limitless 
space. The surface of the horizontal plane is composed of an unidentified and 
indestructible white substance. This material is smooth and similar in texture 
to concrete. The atmosphere is consistent with the terrestrial location of 
SCP-2400. At all times, a star consistent with the Sun is visible in the sky, 
directly above SCP-2400. 

When the door of SCP-2400 is closed, the rate of time within SCP-2400-A, 
relative to the exterior world, undergoes severe temporal dilation. One (1) 
second of normal time corresponds approximately to one hundred-forty (140) 
seconds within SCP-2400-A. While SCP-2400 is closed, SCP-2400-A and the exterior 
world are virtually independent of and inaccessible to one another; neither 
matter nor energy is capable of crossing the threshold. While SCP-2400 is open, 
however, the rate of relative time inside SCP-2400-A is the same as Earth.

It was determined that the nature of SCP-2400-A's temporal anomaly was 
counter-productive to containment of other SCP objects in the area. However, it 
was also suggested that SCP-2400-A could be utilized for the expedited 
production of containment-critical materials, or the development of containment 
protocols (including technological research and testing) of other anomalies. 
This proposal was approved, and Site-64T was constructed inside SCP-2400-A. 

Site-64T consists of five (5) floors, the base of which covers an area of 
1.51km2. The first floor contains the administrative offices, power plant, 
utilities, and storage. The second floor consists of personnel quarters and 
recreational areas. The third and fourth floors feature production facilities 
for resources including alloys, polymers, complex chemicals, non-perishable 
foods, and weapons. The fifth floor is reserved for research and development.

On 21/7/2008, Overwatch approved a project to research and neutralize SCP-2700, 
and Site-64T was selected for the operation to be carried out. As transportation 
of SCP-2700 to Site-64T proved impossible (due to the dimensions of SCP-2400), 
the research relied entirely on Nikola Tesla's notes regarding the device, and 
the Foundation's own in-house analysis. This resulted, unintentionally, in the 
creation of the Tesla-Anborough Ectoentropic Reactor (TAER), which now serves as 
the primary power source for Site-64T. 

The reactor's core, in essence, contains a self-sustaining paradox wherein the 
vacuum state is simultaneously energetically null and infinitely energetic. The 
former case, as you might guess, should trigger a vacuum metastability event (by 
default a YK-Class Scenario). The latter case, however, seems to actively 
neutralize this reaction. Unusually for a paradox, the interaction here is 
rather fortunate. 

Dr. Thaddeus Xyank 

The TAER can theoretically be reproduced, however, attempts to do so are 
suspended indefinitely. While the artifact is stable, it must remain at Site-64T 
until further notice, due to the ongoing risk of a YK-Class Vacuum Decay 
Scenario. 

Containment Update: The TAER is contained in Site-64T's Generator Room, which is 
constructed of reinforced lead-lined concrete and safeguarded by a reinforced 
steel door. This room can only be accessed by a Clearance 4/2400 technician upon 
order from the Site-59 Director. The status of the TAER should be examined 
weekly by the technician, or every sixty-three (63) minutes if SCP-2400-A is in 
use (coinciding with the weekly reports). The artifact is also safeguarded by an 
automated system linked directly to the Site-64T-side demolition charges 
attached to SCP-2400. In the event of any detected malfunction of the TAER, the 
charges will be automatically detonated.

Audio Transcript, 2400-2700 Anborough-Xyank

Detailed below is a communication between Site-59 Director Charles
Anborough and SCP-2400 Temporal Anomalies Adviser Thaddeus Xyank
describing an urgent proposal regarding containment of SCP-2700.

Xyank: You're fucking crazy.

Anborough: Good morning.

Xyank: You-are-insane.

Anborough: What you're saying has been hypothesized, tested, and
proven, and is therefore boring. My proposal, on the other hand-

Xyank: No, shut up for a moment. This is stupid, deranged, and it's
going to destroy the universe.

Anborough: You're calling my experiments stupid? Also, destroy the
universe? Do you want me to print you a copy of my daily schedule?

Xyank: So help me, Chuck-

Anborough: It's going to work, Thad. It will work.

Xyank: So you figured out what went wrong when Tesla made 2700, that's
great, but you can't fix it.

Anborough: Why not?

Xyank: You can't disassemble the machine.

Anborough: 2700 can be converted into another TAER, it just-

Xyank: You can't disassemble the machine. The moment you do, you'll
breach 2700-Omega, and we're on our merry way to YK town.

Anborough: If it's done precisely, that won't happen.

Xyank: One mistake, one tiny, minuscule error, and we're screwed.
There's no way we can be that precise.

Anborough: We can increase the safety margin, though. The central
components of 2700-C have causal immunity to the temporal effects of
Omega, we reconstructed that causal immunity with the TAER-

Xyank: That's spectacular, we don't know how we did that.

Anborough: But we know we can. If we could establish the same kind of
causal immunity, on a larger scale, around the whole device, we could-

Xyank: We don't have enough material to make a causal shell of that
size.

Anborough: There are other ways to reach that result.

Xyank: …What do you mean?

Anborough: I need one of your temporal sinks.

Xyank: You can't be serious.

Anborough: It would give us enough of a buffer to complete the process
with reasonable safety. Come to think of it, didn't you finish
development of the XACTS at 64T? I know you used data from 2400's
dilation to perfect it…

Xyank: …Okay, first of all, you'd need at least four XACTS, arranged
in a pyramidal orientation and centered around 2700-3, but…

Anborough: But?

Xyank: You think Overwatch is going to go for this? It might work, but
without some kind of test that doesn't involve jeopardizing the
universe, they're never going to approve.

Anborough: Let's do that, then.

Xyank: …What?

Anborough: We'll test it.

Xyank: And how the hell are we going to do that?

Anborough: Well, we didn't only figure out how to turn 2700 into the
TAER…we also know how to do the reverse.

Xyank: …Chuck, are you actually suggesting what I think-

Anborough: All the pieces are already sitting inside 2400. We'll put
in the sinks, close the door, then put everything together and take it
apart again. Thad, we're going to make another 2700.

Proposal 2400-2700 Thaumiel-Ω is currently pending O5 approval.
