Item #: SCP-4011 

Object Class: Thaumiel Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: The former Provisional Area-R01 has been lost. 
Automated lockdown procedures are in effect, and Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53 is 
monitoring the facility entrance. All SCP-4011-1 instances found outside of 
SCP-4011 are to be destroyed on sight should not be approached or otherwise 
provoked until further notice. The SCPS Moksha was launched from Site-███ 
on 2053-01-21, carrying relief forces and supplies for the establishment of 
Armed Area-R02. It is expected to reach Martian orbit on 2053-08-30. Should 
SCP-4011-1 attempt to breach automated Area-R01 defenses before the 
establishment of Armed Area-R02, MTF Upsilon-53 members are advised to retreat 
to a safe location until Foundation rescue forces arrive. 


- Previous Special Containment Procedures 

Notice: these procedures are outdated as of 2053-01-05. 

Provisional Area-R01 has been established around the entrance to SCP-4011 to 
facilitate exploration of the site and communication with SCP-4011-1. 
SCP-4011-1B and -1C instances are prohibited from leaving SCP-4011, and -1A 
instances must not travel beyond the isolation corridor. Mobile Task Force 
Upsilon-53 ("Alien Robots In Space") is assigned to monitor the isolation 
corridor and perform regular exploration missions within SCP-4011. Before 
beginning scheduled explorations, the commander of MTF Upsilon-53 is to 
ascertain the current mental state of SCP-4011-1. Should conditions be judged 
unfavorable, the exploration is to be postponed. 

Records obtained from SCP-4011-1 are to be relayed immediately to the RAISA 
Central Office at Administrative Site-██. RAISA staff may, at their 
discretion, administer remote amnesticization1 to personnel exposed to 
information classified beyond their clearance level.

Description: SCP-4011 is a facility located within and beneath Victoria Crater 
on Mars. The only known entrance to the structure is an airlock hidden beneath 
an alcove on the northern rim of the crater. The full extent of the facility is 
currently unknown likely to be infinite. The architecture and symbols found 
within the facility are similar to those of a standard Foundation site, though 
the materials used for construction appear to be of Martian origin. 

The interior of the facility is entirely isolated from the outside, and neither 
traditional radio communication nor any tested anomalous communication system2 
will allow a signal to pass between the facility's interior and its exterior. 
The internal atmosphere is comprised almost entirely of argon gas, with trace 
concentrations of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. 

SCP-4011-1 is the designation given to a large-scale, distributed anomalous 
artificial intelligence system within SCP-4011, comprised of a large number3 of 
robotic beings, each individually sapient yet also interconnected into an 
overall hierarchy.4 SCP-4011 is inhabited solely by instances of SCP-4011-1, 
which perform various maintenance and administrative tasks. SCP-4011-1 instances 
show a large degree of variation in form; the 3 currently-known categories of 
instance have been designated SCP-4011-1A through -1C, and are described below. 


- Designation Categories 

Note that recordings from Incident 4011-28 show multiple SCP-4011-1 instances 
which do not appear to correspond with known -1 sub-designations. As such, this 
table should not be considered complete. 

Designation 

Appearance 

Observed Function 


SCP-4011-1A 

Humanoid androids made of a polished, metallic material. Height tends to vary 
between 1.7 and 2.5 meters. Body shapes and proportions correspond to those of 
humans, though they lack fine detail or facial features. 

General maintenance tasks and communication with other beings. Observations 
during Incident 4011-28 indicate that they may serve as higher-level 
coordinating nodes in the hierarchy, directing other instances during combat or 
similar activities necessitating mass organization. 


SCP-4011-1B 

Sets of metallic spheres, usually organized as a single larger sphere with a 
'tail' of smaller spheres extending below it. Instances vary widely in diameter, 
with the smallest measuring as small as 2 centimeters in primary-sphere diameter 
and the largest reaching 1 meter. Instances are capable of levitation and flight 
through unknown means, and are also capable of receiving, transmitting, and 
jamming signals sent through radio-frequency and [REDACTED] channels, though 
instances are not thought to be immune to the effect of SCP-4011's boundary. 

Data storage, transmission, and processing within the SCP-4011 hierarchy, as 
well as covert data exfiltration from and interference with external computer 
systems. 


SCP-4011-1C 

Small pyramids made of the same material as -1A and -1B instances, measuring 1 
centimeter to a side. Capable of exerting an anomalous force to form materials 
around them into arbitrary shapes, instances have often been observed to 
construct 'shells' around themselves when traveling outside of SCP-4011. 
Instances are capable of levitation and flight through unknown means. 

Rough construction and repair tasks. Instances do not appear to be capable of 
fine manipulation of materials; however, individual instances have been observed 
carrying masses estimated at up to 12 tonnes, and they are capable of lifting 
larger masses through the coordination of multiple instances. 


SCP-4011-1 has demonstrated extremely in-depth knowledge of world history (and 
particularly the history of the Foundation), and it has shared detailed 
descriptions of previously-unknown events. To date, all provided information 
which can be verified has proven accurate. Recovered documents have been used to 
discover, explain, and improve upon containment procedures for more than ██ 
other SCP objects. As such, SCP-4011 has been classified as Thaumiel, 
Threat-Level Orange as of 2052-08-12 By O5 order on 2053-01-05, SCP-4011 has 
been reclassified as Keter TL-Orange and no further communication or interaction 
with SCP-4011-1 is permitted without direct approval from the O5 Council and 
Ethics Subcommittee on SCP-4011. 

SCP-4011-2 refers to level B17 of SCP-4011 and all levels below it.

- Addendum 1: Discovery 

SCP-4011 was first discovered on 2006-09-30, when the Martian exploration vessel 
MER-B5 photographed an artificial structure bearing the Foundation logo while 
exploring Victoria Crater. Foundation agents embedded in NASA were able to 
quickly halt the initial spread of the image, administering amnestics to exposed 
employees and altering the rover's planned course to prevent further encounters. 

Due to the worrying implications of an unknown Foundation-marked structure on 
the surface of Mars, exploration of the anomaly was deemed a moderate priority. 
However, remote-operated vehicle missions in 2009 and 2012 met with failure: 
contact with the rovers was lost immediately upon entry due to SCP-4011's 
communications-blocking effect, and the vehicles' auto-pilot systems failed to 
guide them out of the facility. Manned missions were deemed impractical until 
the 2049 Three Portlands Accord eased tensions with several groups of interest, 
reducing the need for Foundation orbital defenses and opening unique 
opportunities for collaborative efforts with certain approved anomalous 
entities. With the assistance of GoI-1115,6 Provisional Area-R01 was established 
around the entrance to SCP-4011 on 2052-06-06.

Foreword: No activity was detected from SCP-4011 during the establishment of 
Provisional Area-R01. On 2052-06-12, MTF Upsilon-53 entered the facility for a 
preliminary exploration. 

Note: Text marked in green indicates internal communications.7 

<Begin Log Excerpt, 2052-06-12 21:15 Earth-GMT> 

[MTF Upsilon-53 proceeds into SCP-4011 from Provisional Area-R01. Communications 
are cut off as the task force passes the threshold. Approximately 1 minute after 
entry, an SCP-4011-1A instance approaches, denoted 1A-1.] 

<%U53-Mallow>: Skip at 3:00 

1A-1: You have entered a secure SCP Foundation facility. Please provide 
identification immediately. 

<%U53-Mallow>: Looks like we found out what happened to those rovers. 

< U53-Fenn>: Should we provide our auth codes? 

<%U53-Mallow>: I have a feeling it's that or start shooting. 

< U53-Lily>: Try a handshake protocol. 

< U53-Lily>: HP6 

<%U53-Mallow>: Acknowledged. 

U53-Mallow: Foundation Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53, here on an approved 
exploration mission. Handshake protocol 6, challenge: [REDACTED]. 

1A-1: Response: [REDACTED]8. 

U53-Mallow: Counter-Response: [REDACTED]. 

1A-1: Verified. We apologize for the formalities, #411. Your task force has been 
cleared for entry. Do you require assistance in accessing the archives? 

U53-Mallow: First, we need to ask a few questions. 

< U53-Fenn>: Did the entity just mention your serial, Mallow? 

<%U53-Mallow>: Yes. It also knows the response to [REDACTED] - it could be 
accessing a Foundation network. 

< U53-Lily>: I'm checking our local. This channel might be compromised; 
recommend minimum of communication. 

< U53-Mallow>: Approved. 

U53-Mallow: When was this facility built, and by whom? 

1A-1: Site-32M19 was constructed by the SCP Foundation. Construction began on 
18538-12 538:14 FST9 and the facility was declared open on 18541-68 110:00 
FST.10 

U53-Mallow: What is its purpose? 

1A-1: The mission statement of Site-32M19 is as follows: "To maintain a 
comprehensive historical archive of the SCP Foundation and its subject peoples, 
and to maintain the security and sovereignty of the Foundation by…" 

[The entity is silent for approximately three seconds.] 

1A-1: Apologies. The remainder of the mission statement is classified beyond 
your current clearance level. 

< U53-Lily>: I'm seeing a lot of encrypted radio chatter. Whatever that skip is, 
it isn't alone. 

<%U53-Mallow>: How many? 

< U53-Lily>: At least 200 within 15 meters. Too much traffic to identify 
individuals. 

U53-Mallow: And what is our current clearance level? 

1A-1: Abridged codelist: 1/GENERAL, 3/4011 and therefore 3/Site-32M19, 
2/Area-R01. Would you like a full report? 

< U53-Fenn>: Those codes are accurate. Whatever this is, it knows more about the 
Foundation than we do. Recommend retreating for now - this information needs to 
get to command. 

< U53-Lily>: Seconding. These entities outnumber us and there is a good chance 
that they know our killcodes. 

<%U53-Mallow>: Approved 

U53-Mallow: That's not necessary at this time. We're leaving. 

1A-1: Affirmative. Have a pleasant evening, #411. 

[MTF Upsilon-53 exits SCP-4011 without issue.]

- Addendum 3: Excerpts from Recovered Documents 

Between 2052-06-12 and 2053-01-05, the RAISA Central Office received a total of 
652 documents from SCP-4011-1. All documents are either large, black hard-cover 
books with pages in A4 size (scanned, transmitted to the RAISA Central Office, 
and stored on-site at Area-R01), or Foundation-Database-Protocol-compatible data 
files. 

Document Title: Biography of Ronald Esther 

Recovered: 2052-06-15 

Type: Book - 3,581 pages. 

Summary: A complete biography of a prominent Serpent's Hand member, going into 
extremely-intimate detail regarding upbringing, philosophy, employment history, 
and activities as recent as 2052-06-14. Information was used to launch a raid on 
the subject's cell on 2052-06-20, leading to the capture of all 25 members and 
the disruption of a planned assault on Site-███. 

Amnestics administered: None. 

Document Title: Report: SCP-████11 

Recovered: 2052-08-30 

Type: FDP file - standard SCP report 

Summary: A document describing SCP-████. The document is similar to 
current Foundation documentation on SCP-████, except for the addition of 
a 20,532-word section labeled "Origin." This section goes into exacting detail 
in describing the object's creation by a branch of the Church of the Broken God 
in 1851. Analysis of the documentation is still ongoing, and has led to the 
identification of several historical figures as Church members. Additionally, a 
previously-unknown property of SCP-████ was discovered through analysis 
of tests allegedly performed during the object's creation, leading to a 
significant improvement in containment procedures. 

Amnestics administered: Remote Expungement Compulsion Signal C, administered to 
MTF Upsilon-53. 

Document Title: Ethics Committee Investigation Into O5-Council Actions Regarding 
[REDACTED] 

Recovered: 2052-12-25 

Type: FDP file - Ethics Committee Investigation Report - 1,251 pages 

Summary: [REDACTED] 

Amnestics administered: Remote Expungement Compulsion Signal A, administered to 
MTF Upsilon-53. Targeted Memetic Amnestic 32T administered via multicast to all 
Area-R01 and RAISA Central Office staff under clearance 5/4011.

- Addendum 4: Incident 4011-16 

Incident 4011-16 

Date: 2052-11-07 

Description of Incident: During a conversation with Area-R01 Director Eva 
Waterford, Specialist Fenn demonstrated signs of memory compromise, referring to 
a nonexistent anomalous group named the "Nation of Lodia." This conversation was 
recorded by Area sensors, and an abridged transcript is provided below. 

<Begin Recording Excerpt, 2052-11-07 18:41 Earth-GMT> 

Specialist Fenn: I'm just worried we won't have a Foundation to come home to, 
with the war and all. 

Director Waterford: I'm sorry? 

Fenn: You know. I'm sure we'll beat the Lodians soon and everything will be 
fine, but… what if we don't? We might be trapped here for the rest of our 
lives! And then we'll have to figure out what to do when you humans start 
running out of supplies- 

Waterford: Fenn? 

Fenn: Yes? 

Waterford: What are you talking about? The Foundation isn't at war with anyone. 

[At this point, Director Waterford activates a silent alarm, summoning Area 
security forces.] 

Fenn: Director, the Nation of Lodia is the largest threat the Foundation has 
ever seen! We've been at war for three years! How else do you explain why we 
came here? Why Frostman willingly helped the Foundation, after all we've done to 
them? 

Waterford: Command Override: ████████ 312. 

[Fenn is paralyzed by the override command as security staff enter the room. 
Note that he is not rendered incapable of speech.] 

Waterford: Sorry, Fenn. One of us has been seriously affected by 4011. Security, 
place Fenn and I into isolation and raise Code █████ with Command. 

Fenn: Eva, we were in Site-64 when it fell!12 

[Director Waterford is led away by security staff to an isolation cell. 
Specialist Fenn is carried to a separate cell.] 

<End Recording Excerpt> 

Resolution: After interrogation, similar memories were found in all members of 
Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53. All memories of the "Nation of Lodia" were 
expunged from task-force members using Remote Expungement Compulsion Signal E 
and replaced with reconstructed memories that reflect actual events. 

Foundation analysis of this incident indicates that SCP-4011 produces a strong 
memetic effect, modifying the memories of exposed personnel to include false 
groups and events.

Item #: SCP-4011

Object Class: Thaumiel Keter

Special Containment Procedures: The former Provisional Area-R01 has
been lost. Automated lockdown procedures are in effect, and Mobile
Task Force Upsilon-53 is monitoring the facility entrance. All
SCP-4011-1 instances found outside of SCP-4011 are to be destroyed on
sight should not be approached or otherwise provoked until further
notice. The SCPS Moksha was launched from Site-205 on 2053-01-21,
carrying relief forces and supplies for the establishment of Armed
Area-R02. It is expected to reach Martian orbit on 2053-08-30. Should
SCP-4011-1 attempt to breach automated Area-R01 defenses before the
establishment of Armed Area-R02, MTF Upsilon-53 members are advised to
retreat to a safe location until Foundation rescue forces arrive.


- Previous Special Containment Procedures

Notice: these procedures are outdated as of 2053-01-05.

Provisional Area-R01 has been established around the entrance to
SCP-4011 to facilitate exploration of the site and communication with
SCP-4011-1. SCP-4011-1B and -1C instances are prohibited from leaving
SCP-4011, and -1A instances must not travel beyond the isolation
corridor. Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53 ("Alien Robots In Space") is
assigned to monitor the isolation corridor and perform regular
exploration missions within SCP-4011. Before beginning scheduled
explorations, the commander of MTF Upsilon-53 is to ascertain the
current mental state of SCP-4011-1. Should conditions be judged
unfavorable, the exploration is to be postponed.

Records obtained from SCP-4011-1 are to be relayed immediately to the
RAISA Central Office at Administrative Site-10. RAISA staff may, at
their discretion, administer remote amnesticization1 to personnel
exposed to information classified beyond their clearance level.

One member of MTF Upsilon-53 is to remain within the bounds of
SCP-4011 at all times. Every 24 hours, this member is to rotate out
and be thoroughly debriefed by a staff member of at least 4/4011
clearance. Should an Alpha-1-7 Event be indicated, staff are to
investigate and record all theorized modifications to reality.


Description: SCP-4011 is a facility located within and beneath
Victoria Crater on Mars. The only known entrance to the structure is
an airlock hidden beneath an alcove on the northern rim of the crater.
The full extent of the facility is currently unknown likely to be
infinite. The architecture and symbols found within the facility are
similar to those of a standard Foundation site, though the materials
used for construction appear to be of Martian origin.

The interior of the facility is entirely isolated from the outside,
and neither traditional radio communication nor any tested anomalous
communication system2 will allow a signal to pass between the
facility's interior and its exterior. The internal atmosphere is
comprised almost entirely of argon gas, with low concentrations of
nitrogen and carbon dioxide.

SCP-4011-1 is the designation given to a large-scale, distributed
anomalous artificial intelligence system within SCP-4011, comprised of
a large number3 of robotic beings, each individually sapient yet also
interconnected into an overall hierarchy.4 SCP-4011 is inhabited
solely by instances of SCP-4011-1, which perform various maintenance
and administrative tasks. SCP-4011-1 instances show a large degree of
variation in form - the 3 currently-known categories of instance have
been designated SCP-4011-1A through -1C, and are described below.


- Designation Categories

Designation

Appearance

Observed Function


SCP-4011-1A

Humanoid androids made of a polished, metallic material. Height tends
to vary between 1.7 and 2.5 meters. Body shapes and proportions
correspond to those of humans, though they lack fine detail or facial
features.

General maintenance tasks and communication with other beings.
Observations during Incident 4011-28 indicate that they may serve as
higher-level coordinating nodes in the hierarchy, directing other
instances during combat or similar activities necessitating mass
organization.


SCP-4011-1B

Sets of metallic spheres, usually organized as a single larger sphere
with a 'tail' of smaller spheres extending below it. Instances vary
widely in diameter, with the smallest measuring as small as 2
centimeters in primary-sphere diameter and the largest reaching 1
meter. Instances are capable of levitation and flight through unknown
means, and are also capable of receiving, transmitting, and jamming
signals sent through radio-frequency and thaumaturgic channels, though
instances are not thought to be immune to the effect of SCP-4011's
boundary.

Data storage, transmission, and processing within the SCP-4011
hierarchy, as well as covert data exfiltration from and interference
with external computer systems.


SCP-4011-1C

Small pyramids made of the same material as -1A and -1B instances,
measuring 1 centimeter to a side. Capable of exerting an anomalous
force to form materials around them into arbitrary shapes, instances
have often been observed to construct 'shells' around themselves when
traveling outside of SCP-4011. Instances are capable of levitation and
flight through unknown means.

Rough construction and repair tasks. Instances do not appear to be
capable of fine manipulation of materials; however, individual
instances have been observed carrying masses estimated at up to 12
tonnes, and they are capable of lifting larger masses through the
coordination of multiple instances.


SCP-4011-1 has demonstrated extremely in-depth knowledge of world
history (and particularly the history of the Foundation), and it has
shared detailed descriptions of previously-unknown events. To date,
all provided information which can be verified has proven accurate.
Recovered documents have been used to discover, explain, and improve
upon containment procedures for more than 40 other SCP objects. As
such, SCP-4011 has been classified as Thaumiel, Threat-Level Orange as
of 2052-08-12. Following the events of Addendum 5, SCP-4011 was
reclassified as Threat-Level Black. By O5 order on 2053-01-05,
SCP-4011 has been reclassified as Keter, Threat-Level Orange Black and
no further communication or interaction with SCP-4011-1 is permitted
without direct approval from the O5 Council.

SCP-4011-2 refers to level B17 of SCP-4011 and all levels below it.
Further information can be found in Addendum 6.

- Addendum 3: Excerpts from Recovered Documents

Between 2052-06-12 and 2053-01-05, the RAISA Central Office received a
total of 652 documents from SCP-4011-1. All documents are either
large, black hard-cover books with pages in A4 size (scanned,
transmitted to the RAISA Central Office, and stored on-site at
Area-R01), or Foundation-Database-Protocol-compatible data files. Due
to the sheer volume of data received from SCP-4011, analysis is still
ongoing, and is not expected to be complete until May of 2054 at the
earliest.

Document Title: Biography of Ronald Esther

Recovered: 2052-06-15

Type: Book - 3,581 pages.

Summary: A complete biography of a prominent Serpent's Hand member,
going into extremely-intimate detail regarding upbringing, philosophy,
employment history, and activities as recent as 2052-06-14.
Information was used to launch a raid on the subject's cell on
2052-06-20, leading to the capture of all 25 members and the
disruption of a planned assault on Site-201.

Amnestics administered: None.


Document Title: Report: SCP-████[Contact RAISA for full record]11

Recovered: 2052-08-30

Type: FDP file - standard SCP report

Summary: A document describing SCP-████. The document is similar to
current Foundation documentation on SCP-████, except for the addition
of a 20,532-word section labeled "Origin." This section goes into
exacting detail in describing the object's creation by a branch of the
Church of the Broken God in 1851. Analysis of the documentation is
still ongoing, and has led to the identification of several historical
figures as Church members. Additionally, a previously-unknown property
of SCP-████ was discovered through analysis of tests allegedly
performed during the object's creation, leading to a significant
improvement in containment procedures.

Amnestics administered: Remote Expungement Compulsion Signal C,
administered to MTF Upsilon-53.


Document Title: Ethics Committee Investigation Into O5-Council Actions
Regarding [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF O5-1]

Recovered: 2052-12-25

Type: FDP file - Ethics Committee Investigation Report - 1,251 pages

Summary: [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF O5-1]

Amnestics administered: Remote Expungement Compulsion Signal A,
administered to MTF Upsilon-53. Targeted Memetic Amnestic 32T
administered via multicast to all Area-R01 and RAISA Central Office
staff under clearance 5/4011.


Document Title: History of the Foundation: Middle Period

Recovered: 2052-12-26

Type: Book Series - 5 volumes, average of 4,100 pages per volume

Note: Each book is marked with a vertical red stripe on the front
cover and the words "PRE-REVISION ARCHIVE" at the top of each page.

Summary: Volumes detail an unknown ancient civilization referred to as
the "Foundation under SCP." Foundation society is described as a rigid
caste system, ruled over by an anonymous "Council of Overseers" and
devoted to the containment and study of anomalous entities, in service
to a deity referred to only as "SCP." At its peak, the civilization is
said to have encompassed over half of modern-day Europe. Various
modern SCP objects are described, along with the methods which
Foundation society allegedly used to contain them.

The series also details conflicts between the "Foundation under SCP"
and at least 53 other civilizations, including the Daevite Empire.
Dates in these volumes do not agree with currently-understood
histories of Daevite civilization, with the final volume concluding in
a war fought between the Daevite Empire and the Foundation in 1551.
This war appears to have involved a number of highly-destructive
anomalous weapons, approaching modern eigenweapons in theoretical
destructive potential.

The outcome of this war is unknown, as parts of the final volume have
been blacked out. Unfortunately, the original copies were lost in
Incident 4011-28 before detailed recovery operations could be
attempted.


- Addendum 4: Incident 4011-16

Incident 4011-16

Date: 2052-11-07

Description of Incident: During a conversation with Area-R01 Director
Eva Waterford, Specialist Fenn demonstrated signs of memory
compromise, referring to a nonexistent anomalous group named the
"Nation of Lodia." This conversation was recorded by Area sensors, and
an abridged transcript is provided below.

<Begin Recording Excerpt, 2052-11-07 18:41 Earth-GMT>

Specialist Fenn: I'm just worried we won't have a Foundation to come
home to, with the war and all.

Director Waterford: I'm sorry?

Fenn: You know. I'm sure we'll beat the Lodians soon and everything
will be fine, but… what if we don't? We might be trapped here for the
rest of our lives! And then we'll have to figure out what to do when
you humans start running out of supplies-

Waterford: Fenn?

Fenn: Yes?

Waterford: What are you talking about? The Foundation isn't at war
with anyone.

[At this point, Director Waterford activates a silent alarm, summoning
Area security forces.]

Fenn: Director, the Nation of Lodia is the largest threat the
Foundation has ever seen! We've been at war for three years! How else
do you explain why we came here? Why Frostman willingly helped the
Foundation, after all we've done to them?

Waterford: Command Override: PSREPOSE 312.

[Fenn is paralyzed by the override command as security staff enter the
room. Note that he is not rendered incapable of speech.]

Waterford: Sorry, Fenn. One of us has been seriously affected by 4011.
Security, place Fenn and I into isolation and raise Code Amber with
Command.

Fenn: Eva, we were in Site-64 when it fell!12

[Director Waterford is led away by security staff to an isolation
cell. Specialist Fenn is carried to a separate cell.]

<End Recording Excerpt>

Resolution: After interrogation, similar memories were found in all
members of Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53. All memories of the "Nation
of Lodia" were expunged from task-force members using Remote
Expungement Compulsion Signal E and replaced with reconstructed
memories that reflect actual events. After the events of 2052-12-26,
these memories were identified as the product of an Alpha-1-7 Event,
which likely occurred during a routine exploration of SCP-4011. RECS-E
was used to revert the memory modifications to MTF Upsilon-53 members.

Foundation analysis of this incident indicates that SCP-4011 produces
a strong memetic effect, modifying the memories of exposed personnel
to include false groups and events.

Later events contradict this theory - see Addendum 6.


- Addendum 5: Exploration Log 2052-12-26

Summary of Compiled Data: SCP-4011 Exploration 2052-12-26

Target Object: SCP-4011

Relevant Foundation Assets: Mobile Task Force Upsilon-53

U53-Mallow (PSHUD #411), MTF Lead

U53-Fenn (PSHUD #412), Specialist

U53-Lily (PSHUD #413), Technician

Note: This is a summarized overview of the 2052-12-26 exploration into
SCP-4011. For complete logs of video, network, and other sensory
readings, contact the RAISA Central Office, extension 64011.

Foreword: Previous exploration efforts had been hindered by
SCP-4011-1, who withheld information and prevented free movement of
MTF members, citing insufficient clearance. In order to gain a more
complete understanding of the anomaly, Upsilon-53 Lead Mallow was
granted temporary 5/4011 clearance, with the understanding that this
clearance was provisional and only to be used to access the SCP-4011
facility.

Reminder: Text marked in green indicates internal communications.

<Begin Log Excerpt, 2052-12-26 04:56 Earth-GMT>

[MTF Upsilon-53 enters SCP-4011. As in previous explorations,
Upsilon-53 meets and authenticates credentials with an SCP-4011-1A
instance, referred to as 1A-1.]

1A-1: Verified. We apologize for the formalities, Overseer. Your task
force has been cleared for entry. Do you require assistance in
accessing the archives?

U53-Mallow: That's alright, Archivist.13 What is my clearance level as
pertains to this site?

1A-1: Overseer Mallow, your clearance codes are: 1/GENERAL, 5/4011 and
therefore 5/Site-32M19, and 2/Area-R01. Would you like a full report?

U53-Mallow: That won't be necessary. Are we permitted full access to
this facility?

1A-1: Yes.

U53-Mallow: Then we'll be moving on.

< U53-Lily>: "Overseer Mallow"

< U53-Fenn>: You're moving up in the world, Mal.

<%U53-Mallow>: "Minimum of communications," team. We're here to figure
out where 4011-1 gets its information - let's stay focused on that.

<%U53-Mallow>: Lily, keep track of -1Bs. If anything is causing these
memory events,14 it would be them.

< U53-Lily>: Acknowledged.

< U53-Fenn>: Hold on a moment.

U53-Fenn: Archivist, what's the purpose of this site, again?

1A-1: The mission statement of Site-32M19 is as follows: "To maintain
a comprehensive historical archive of the SCP Foundation and its
subject peoples, and to maintain the security and sovereignty of the
Foundation by…"

U53-Mallow: Archivist, you are permitted to speak the remainder of the statement.

1A-1: "…retroactively neutralizing evident threats through Protocol Alpha-1-7."

U53-Mallow: What is Protocol Alpha-1-7?

1A-1: Apologies, Overseer. We cannot further discuss Protocol
Alpha-1-7 outside of the Alpha-1 Array15.

<%U53-Mallow>: That figures. We'll have to ask when we get down to
B17.

< U53-Lily>: They neutralize threats 'retroactively'?

< U53-Lily>: And they have a seemingly-unlimited knowledge of history.

[MTF Upsilon-53 moves quickly through the upper floors of SCP-4011.
The furthest previous expedition was forced to return before reaching
Level B17 of the facility. The task force reaches this level at 05:15,
after multiple clearance-verification checkpoints.]

<Timestamp: 2052-12-26 05:15>

[MTF Upsilon-53 arrives at a large, reinforced door marked with a
Foundation logo. A sign above reads "Alpha-1 Array" in English, as
well as text in two other languages which are currently unknown and
undergoing analysis. A -1A instance, denoted 1A-2, appears to be
standing guard beside the door.]

1A-2: Overseer.

U53-Mallow: Archivist, we are entering the Alpha-1 Array. Open the
door.

1A-2: As you wish, Overseer.

[Two -1C instances embedded in the door lift it into the ceiling,
revealing a long passageway lined with books of similar make to those
listed in Appendix 3. -1C instances regularly move books between
shelves and onward down the hallway, while -1B instances hover
overhead. Most books in this area are marked with a vertical red
stripe. MTF members continue down the passage.]

< U53-Lily>: Radio activity is extremely dense in this area. It looks
like thaumaturgical channels are in use as well.

<%U53-Mallow>: Keep an eye out for interference. Opinions on the
red-striped books?

< U53-Fenn>: I don't recognize any of the titles. They may describe
otherwise-unknown people and societies.

U53-Lily: It looks like 4011-1 compromised our comms. I would
recommend deactivating network functionality and switching to
voice-only.

U53-Mallow: Approved.

U53-Lily: Also, the entity had approximately three seconds of full
access to our memories. I can't determine more without time and
forensic analysis tools.

U53-Mallow: Let's hope they didn't damage anything important. Onward.

[MTF Upsilon-53 moves further down the passage, scanning the titles of
shelved books as they pass.]

<Timestamp: 2052-12-26 05:22>

U53-Fenn: Mallow?

U53-Mallow: Hmm?

U53-Fenn: Those books are titled "History of the Foundation."

[U53-Fenn indicates a set of four books, each marked with a red
vertical stripe.]

U53-Mallow: Well that'd be an interesting find for Command.

[U53-Mallow approaches the shelf.]

U53-Mallow: Archivist, we'll be transferring these books to another
site.

[A hovering -1B instance responds (referred to as 1B-1)]

1B-1: Confirmed, Overseer. A backup copy has been made. Note that
those volumes were rendered outdated by Events A17-1 through A17-29.

[U53-Mallow removes the volumes. A summary of their contents is
available in Addendum 3.]

<Timestamp: 2052-12-26 05:25>

[U53-Lily has been reading Volume 4 of the recovered work.]

U53-Lily: These pages say "Pre-Revision Archive," and this book's
"Foundation" definitely never existed. It looks like an ancient,
theocratic version of our Foundation that was warring with the
Daevites.

U53-Mallow: Daevites? Do you think this is 140-related?

U53-Lily: This one is set in the 15th century, so we're already past
the black-zone for 140. It also shows the Daevites in control of far
more territory than expected.

U53-Fenn: Maybe this has something to do with "retroactive
neutralization?"

U53-Lily: Perhaps.

<Timestamp: 2052-12-26 05:28>

[MTF Upsilon-53 reaches a large, cylindrical shaft, approximately 50
meters in diameter and with a glass-like floor and ceiling. Seven
other corridors, identical to the one by which Upsilon-53 entered the
chamber, extend outward. An unknown number of chambers can be seen
stacked above and below, fading into a dull blue light. A metallic
tower, 3 meters in diameter, stands in the center of the room,
extending through all visible chambers. On each level, -1C instances
move books between the eight spoke corridors and slots on the central
tower, while -1B instances hover overhead. Five -1A instances stand
around the tower, operating controls.]

[U53-Mallow approaches one of the central -1A instances.]

U53-Mallow: Archivist… What is this?

1A-3: This is the Alpha-1 Array. Directive Alpha-1 is currently active
and- and holding blue.

U53-Lily: Directive Alpha-1. Retroactive neutralization of threats to
the Foundation.

1A-3: That is correct, #413. The weeds, those who seek to smother the
light of SCP, they are many. In a time long past, they grew very
nearly too high, they nearly blocked out the sun of our Foundation.
But now, with Protocol Alpha-1-7, we tear out the roots and the
poisoned blooms fall and dissolve from memory. The Daeva-

[Approximately ten seconds of silence. Another -1A instance speaks.]

1A-3: There was no time long past. The weeds are not and the weeds
never were. SCP will always shine down upon us, the Foundation is-

[Approximately fifteen seconds of silence. A humming sound begins to
emanate from the central pillar.]

1A-4: Activating in five seconds.

1A-3: Overseer Mallow.

U53-Mallow: Archivist?

1A-4: Activating.

1A-3: What is SCP-140?

[A flash of light is seen from the tower. Audio and video recordings
from MTF Upsilon-53 begin to show signs of severe corruption, rapidly
becoming unsalvageable.]

<FEEDS CORRUPTED FOR 10 MINUTES 14 SECONDS>

<Timestamp: 2052-12-26 05:41>

[MTF Upsilon-53 are sprinting through the upper floors of SCP-4011.
U53-Mallow stops. She is carrying the four-volume "History of the
Foundation" series recovered earlier.]

U53-Mallow: What… just happened?

[U53-Fenn and U53-Lily stop]

U53-Fenn: We were in 4011-2. There was a flash of light, and…

U53-Lily: Our memories may have been compromised. We had been running
toward the exit - recommend that we leave immediately.

U53-Mallow: Approved.

[MTF Upsilon-53 exit the facility without further incident.]

<End Log Excerpt>


- Addendum 6: SCP-4011-2

SCP-4011-2 is a temporal modification device, currently believed to be
the reason for which SCP-4011 was built. SCP-4011-1 regularly use this
device, termed the "Alpha-1 Array," to purge various people and groups
from existence by retroactively disrupting the circumstances which led
to their creation. The entities appear to perform this procedure,
which they term "Protocol Alpha-1-7," to neutralize persons and groups
which present an existential threat to the SCP Foundation.

Because SCP-4011-2 acts retrocausally, it is currently not possible to
detect or trace Alpha-1-7 Events. However, beings within SCP-4011 at
the time of an Alpha-1-7 Event appear unaffected by it, and retain
their memories of the previous timeline. SCP-4011-1 are, as such,
unaffected by their own modifications to the timeline. They maintain
an archive of civilizations and peoples, both in the current timeline
and in those eliminated through Alpha-1-7 Events.

Through the monitoring efforts of MTF Upsilon-53, the effects of five
Alpha-1-7 Events have been observed. A summary of the first
encountered Alpha-1-7 Event is described below; all known information
on the five observed events can be found in Supplementary Log
4011/5-2.

Summary of Alpha-1-7 Event

Reporting Individuals:16 U53-Mallow, U53-Fenn, U53-Lily

Target Persons or Groups: An anomalous group called the Nation of
Lodia.

State Before A17 Event: The Nation of Lodia began in 2046 as a covert
society of anomalous humanoids. This society remained unknown to the
Foundation until 2049, when it began to attack Foundation outposts
using advanced anomalous technology. At least twelve sites were lost
before the Alpha-1-7 Event in 2052.

State After A17 Event: Foundation investigatory AICs discovered
evidence of the Nation of Lodia only two months after its initial
founding, and a raid on 2046-11-10 led to the dissolution of the group
and the capture of key leaders. No further activity has been detected
from the group.

SCP-4011-1 has made frequent and vehement requests for access to
SCP-140 since the events detailed in Addendum 5. In the course of
these requests, it has revealed that it is unable to affect parts of
the timeline overwritten by SCP-140 or destroy the object itself.

MTF Upsilon-53 has noted that, since beginning requests for SCP-140,
SCP-4011-1A instances have spoken less coherently. Requests now
include an increased number of pauses and verbal glitches, as well as
an increasing use of religious imagery referring to a deity called
"SCP" (see Addendum 3).

Following the events of Incident 4011-28, MTF Upsilon-53 are no longer
able to access SCP-4011, and the Foundation is thus unable to detect
further Alpha-1-7 Events.


- Addendum 7: Incident 4011-28

Incident 4011-28

Date: 2053-01-05

Description of Incident: After the Foundation refused to transfer an
SCP object to SCP-4011-1, a large number of SCP-4011-1 instances
emerged from SCP-4011 and assaulted Provisional Area-R01.

Abridged Timeline (all timestamps are Earth-GMT)

<2053-01-03 16:08>: An SCP-4011-1A instance approaches U53-Lily, who
is stationed within SCP-4011 to detect Alpha-1-7 Events. The instance
makes the following declaration:

1A-1: #413, we have come to a conclu- conclusion regarding SCP-140.
Relay it to #411 and the Overseer Council. It is this: the object must
be destroyed, lest it threaten the light of SCP. The Council of
Overseers lie in the dark beyond SCP. They are unaware, and we have-
have made this so. Now, the object has intertwined itself too closely
with them, and the Alpha Array cannot return the Overseers to the
light.

1A-1: Thus, we must ask once more: give the book- book to us. Let us
destroy it. Otherwise, our orders from the Protector SCP must force
our action.

<2053-01-03 20:18>: The O5 council votes unanimously to reject
SCP-4011-1's request. No response to their ultimatum is provided.

<2053-01-04 17:00>: During a routine shift-change as part of SCP-4011
monitoring, U53-Mallow is prevented from entering the anomaly.

<2053-01-04 17:06>: Area-R01 is placed on alert due to unexpected
action by a contained anomaly. The incident is relayed to Earth.

<2053-01-05 00:00>: Multiple -1B instances emerge from SCP-4011.

<2053-01-05 01:01>: At least 30 -1B instances are observed in the
isolation corridor connecting SCP-4011 and Area-R01. All sensor feeds
fail, and contact is lost with Area-R01. Further information has been
reconstructed from readings gathered by MTF Upsilon-53, including
broadcast messages from automated Area-R01 systems.

2. See Testing Log 4011-C for a full record of attempted communication methods 
and failure modes. 

3. The full extent of SCP-4011-1 is unknown; however, more than 3,800 unique 
instances were observed during Incident 4011-28. 

4. The effect is similar to a "hive mind", though it is organized into tight 
groupings which form a tree structure. 

5. Commonly known as the "Opportunity" Mars rover. 

6. The cooperation of GoI-1115, Frostman Robotics (formerly Anderson Robotics 
until 2044-01-01) has proven particularly useful in conducting extraplanetary 
Foundation operations, as agents constructed to their standards show the ability 
to work autonomously in hostile atmospheric conditions for extended periods of 
time. 

7. PSHUD units are capable of communicating through a secure, ad-hoc wireless 
network with a manufacturer-provided optimum range of 150 meters. It is likely 
that this communication was intercepted by SCP-4011-1. 

8. Valid. 

9. Dates given by SCP-4011-1 are always provided in this format. Correlation 
with known historical events indicates that this date corresponds to 1551-03-30. 

10. 1552-11-11. 

11. Before the recovery of this document, the original creators of 
SCP-████ were unknown. 

12. Fenn had been assigned to Site-64 before the formation of MTF Upsilon-53, 
where he had served as a research assistant for SCP-140 and SCP-3560. However, 
no significant containment breaches or outside hostile operations occurred 
during this time. 

13. The title by which SCP-4011-1 entities request to be referred.

14. At this time, Alpha-1-7 Events were still thought to be the result of 
SCP-4011-1 modifying the memories of MTF Upsilon-53

15. SCP-4011-2

16. Persons who were within SCP-4011 at the time of the event.
