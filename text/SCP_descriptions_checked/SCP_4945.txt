Item #: SCP-4945 

Object Class: Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: The rails SCP-4945 drives on have been 
constructed into a circular loop with a length of 1km. A 10km2 exclusion zone 
around SCP-4945's loop is to be evacuated and public access is to be denied 
under the pretence of military testing. Unauthorised persons attempting to enter 
the exclusion zone are to be detained, questioned and subsequently administered 
Class-A amnestics. MTF-Theta-1 "Trainspotters" are to be stationed evenly at 
250m intervals on both the inside and outside of the loop. Speed cameras are to 
be placed at 100m intervals constantly pointed towards SCP-4945 with updates and 
changes in speed relayed to MTF-Theta-1. Should SCP-4945's speed drop below 
30km/h all units are to prepare for T-Delta Event. Any hostile instances of 
SCP-4945-1 exiting SCP-4945 are to be shot and neutralised on sight; non-hostile 
SCP-4945-1 are to be subdued, detained and questioned if possible, for the 
period of materialisation, unless otherwise ordered by level 4 or above research 
staff. 

Description: SCP-4945 is a standard Royal Class DMU Passenger Train located at 
███████ Railway, UK. Despite having no apparent driver, SCP-4945 
is capable of movement, changes in speed and changes in direction. SCP-4945 
requires no fuel and can run seemingly indefinitely. There is no discernible 
pattern to the speed and direction of SCP-4945's movement. 

SCP-4945-1 is the collective designation given to entities materialised on 
SCP-4945. SCP-4945-1 instances are a range of varied objects and autonomous 
entities.1 Up to ~45 SCP-4945-1 instances can be visible at any one time; 
however, entities will sporadically materialise and dematerialise at intervals 
of 10-180 seconds. 

While SCP-4945 is travelling above 20km/h SCP-4945-1 are unable to disembark 
SCP-4945. Should SCP-4945 be travelling below 20km/h SCP-4945-1 will attempt to 
exit SCP-4945; this is designated a 4945-Delta Event. Once SCP-4945-1 has 
disembarked SCP-4945 instances can last from anywhere between 4-10 minutes 
before dematerialising and range from harmless to extremely dangerous. 

Discovery: Reports of a "ghost train" in local ███████, UK started 
gaining popularity with townsfolk. Local reports included descriptions of 
different SCP-4945-1 instances observed, including old western American cowboys 
and "Hot Wheels" branded toy cars among others. Embedded Foundation agents in 
███████ investigated, discovering SCP-4945 moving at a pace of 
55km/h with no apparent driver. Agents requested Foundation assistance and 
disinformation routines were enacted on ███████ and surrounding 
towns.

Minimum Speed 

Description 

4945-Delta-03 

16km/h 

SCP-4945 was observed to have ~80 SCP-4945-1 in the form of origami foxes on 
board. Upon reaching 16km/h, all of the origami SCP-4945-1 attempted to jump 
from SCP-4945, resulting in most of them being blown away and the rest being 
crushed under SCP-4945's wheels. A large SCP-4945-1 in the form of an origami 
fox, measuring approximately 140cmx230cm, then departed from SCP-4945 and 
attacked nearby units. MTF-Theta-1 was able to neutralise the instance after 2 
minutes, suffering two casualties. 

4945-Delta-07 

0km/h 

Upon hitting 20km/h, four SCP-4945-1 jumped off SCP-4945 in the form of monkeys 
and began hurling faeces at MTF-Theta-1 Units. SCP-4945-1 were promptly subdued 
as SCP-4945 came to a full stop. Another SCP-4945-1 emerged from SCP-4945 in the 
form of an Apollo-11 Spacesuit,2 and began vocalising a misquoted version of 
Neil Armstrong's first words on the moon, in a voice matching identically to 
Armstrong; "That's a small step for a man, but a big leap for another man." 

4945-Delta-09 

4km/h 

SCP-4945-1 in the form of a female child with long blonde hair and blue eyes 
departed from SCP-4945. SCP-4945-1 instance approached MTF-Theta-1 Units and 
vocalised, "Where's D█████? I love D█████! He's my 
favouritest in the whole world! Where are you D█████? I need you!", 
before dematerialising. This was the third time this specific form of SCP-4945-1 
had manifested.3 

Incident 4945-Delta-16: 

Frequency of 4945-Delta events had increased exponentially since SCP-4945's 
discovery. On 25/07/20██ SCP-4945 came to a complete stop from 67km/h in 
under 0.02 seconds. Almost immediately an SCP-4945-1 instance, in the form of a 
middle-aged adult male, exited SCP-4945 and surrendered to MTF-Theta-1 forces 
compliantly. Questioning of the entity revealed major flaws in the original 
document for SCP-4945, and as such a new document has been produced. Special 
Containment Procedures have been updated accordingly, comply with new procedures 
immediately. Interview follows: 

Interviewed: SCP-4945-1 

Interviewer: MTF-Theta-1-04 

Foreword: Theta-1 were briefed in interrogating non-threatening SCP-4945-1 
instances and given a line of questioning to follow should it be required. 

MTF-Theta-1-04: SCP-4945-1, Who or what are you? 

SCP-4945-1: I assume you mean me? Well, I'm not all that important really. 

MTF-Theta-1-04: Your importance is irrelevant. Who or what are you? 

SCP-4945-1: Well isn't it obvious? I'm D█████'s dad. Well, I'm not 
D█████'s dad but that's what I represent for sure. 

MTF-Theta-1-04: Who is D█████? 

SCP-4945-1: I just told you, my son. 

MTF-Theta-1-04: What do you and your son have to do with the train stopped 
behind you? 

SCP-4945-1: I don't really have anything to do with it, of course, I can't say 
the same for D█████'s real father. 

MTF-Theta-1-04: What are you talking about? 

SCP-4945-1: I may just be an imagined version of him but I still hold some of 
his memories, at least the ones D█████ also experienced. 

MTF-Theta-1-04: Can you explain what you mean by imagined version? 

SCP-4945-1: None of this is real of course, we're all in D█████'s 
head. How could you not know that? You're here too? 

MTF-Theta-1-04: Where's D█████'s location? 

SCP-4945-1: Oh he's probably just- 

SCP-4945-1 dematerialised as SCP-4945 began to move again. Investigations into 
D█████ were launched and facial recognition programs were run looking 
for a match with the SCP-4945-1 instance. A match for the SCP-4945-1 instance 
was found in ███████, UK and Foundation agents detained the match 
and designated them PoI-25053. His son D█████ was with him and was 
designated SCP-4945-A.

Revised Document 27/07/20██ 



Item #: SCP-4945

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4945-A is to be kept in a standard
humanoid containment cell, with full furnishings and amenities
available. SCP-4945-A is to have weekly psychological evaluations to
maintain mental strength. Should degeneration in SCP-4945-A's mental
ability be noticed, psychiatrists must immediately alert on-site
administration. SCP-4945-A is permitted full access to PoI-25053,
however, conversations must be monitored and recorded for security
purposes.

The railway for SCP-4945-B is to be extended as much as physically
possible in the 3km2 area around the current loop. Rail is to weave in
and around itself in no discernable pattern. 10km2 exclusion zone
around the centre of SCP-4945-B's rail line is to remain and public
access is to remain restricted under the pretence of military weapons
testing. Unauthorised persons attempting to enter the exclusion zone
are to be detained, questioned and subsequently administered Class-A
amnestics. MTF-Theta-1 "Trainspotters" are to be stationed at guard
posts at the perimeter of 3km2 area. Should SCP-4945-B-1 entities
disembark SCP-4945-B they should be allowed to roam free however they
may not cross the perimeter. Should any entity cross the perimeter
they must be ushered and turned around non-violently if possible.
Neutralisation of entities is only permitted as a last resort.

Description: SCP-4945-A is a ██-year-old male child with short brown
hair, brown eyes and responds to the name D█████. SCP-4945-A's
behaviour is complementary of its age. When SCP-4945-A imagines any
object, creature or sentient being, it materialises within the cabins
of SCP-4945-B. Entities too big to fit within SCP-4945-B cabins are
minimised in materialisation. SCP-4945-A's level of focus is directly
proportional to the speed SCP-4945-B travels and inversely
proportional to the number of SCP-4945-B-1 entities on board at any
one time.1

SCP-4945-B is a standard Royal Class DMU Passenger Train located at
███████ Railway, UK. Despite having no apparent driver, SCP-4945-B is
capable of movement, changes in speed and changes in direction.
SCP-4945-B requires no fuel and can run seemingly indefinitely.
Changes in speed and direction of movement of SCP-4945-B are directly
correlated to SCP-4945-A's state of focus.

SCP-4945-B-1 is the collective designation given to entities
materialised on SCP-4945-B. SCP-4945-B-1 instances are a range of
varied objects and autonomous entities, limited to anything within
SCP-4945-A's imagination. Up to ~45 SCP-4945-B-1 instances can be
visible at any one time, however, entities will sporadically
materialise and dematerialise at intervals of 10-180 seconds.

While SCP-4945-B is travelling above 20km/h SCP-4945-B-1 are unable to
disembark SCP-4945-B. Should SCP-4945-B be travelling below 20km/h
SCP-4945-B-1 will attempt to exit SCP-4945-B, this is designated a
T-Delta Event. Once SCP-4945-B-1 has disembarked SCP-4945-B instances
can last from anywhere between 4-10 minutes before dematerialising and
range from harmless to extremely dangerous.


Addendum 4945.01:

Upon arrival at Site-██, SCP-4945-A and its father PoI-25053 were
separated into different cells. PoI-25053 was questioned to determine
if he had any information on SCP-4945-A's anomalous nature. Interview
follows:

Interviewed: PoI-25053

Interviewer: Dr. F██████

Foreword: Interview taken 12 minutes after separation from SCP-4945-A.

Dr. F██████: Hello PoI-25053, I'm Dr. F██████, can you please state
your name for the record?

PoI-25053: Uh, my name is David ██████. Is my son going to be ok?

Dr. F██████: He's going to be fine, he's just having some tests run at
the moment. Can you tell me what you know about his anomalous
abilities Mr. ██████?

PoI-25053: Just David is fine.

Dr. F██████: Alright David, what can you tell me about your son?

PoI-25053: Look, I just want to say, he's a good kid. None of this is
his fault. I mean really he's an angel. It's just that he's always had
trouble focusing on any type of task. He just can't seem to
concentrate as you or I may do.

Dr. F██████: And what does this have to do with SCP-4945-B? The train
with his thoughts?

PoI-25053: I didn't do it directly. One day a man in a suit came by
our house and offered a new treatment to help D█████ with his focus
issues. I was at my wit's end, and anything that could possibly help
him, I was willing to try.

Dr. F██████: What exactly did this individual offer you?

PoI-25053: He said he had a way to get him to focus more, and he
showed me pictures of a train. He said by making the thoughts D█████
had into reality he would be able to control them more easily. Of
course, I scoffed at this because it sounded ridiculous, but the man
seemed to be dead serious. So I said why not.

Dr. F██████: How did this individual create the anomalous link between
the train and your son?

PoI-25053: Anomalous just means weird right? [Dr. F██████ nods] Well
it definitely was weird, that's for sure. [PoI-25053 chuckles to
himself] He drove me to the little town of ███████, and showed me the
train he intended to use. He told me he needed my full blessing, or it
wouldn't work and it would only make things worse for D█████. I was
still sceptical, but I didn't want to risk things getting even worse
for him, so I agreed. About a minute went by, and nothing happened. I
was about to hit the guy for giving me false hope for D█████, and then
it started moving, without a driver. I couldn't believe it.

Dr. F██████: And was D█████ aware of the existence of this train?

PoI-25053: No. He still isn't, I didn't want him to see it, and think
of me as some sort of controlling father trying to see into his
thoughts. The train worked great though, until a couple months back. I
hadn't checked on it in a good while, but D█████ was saying that he
couldn't think as clearly anymore. He said it felt like he was going
in circles with his thoughts. So I went to drive down to the train and
I was stopped at an armed checkpoint, there was some sort of military
testing occurring and I had to turn back.

These dates correlate directly to the first Foundation intervention of
SCP-4945-B, and the changing of its tracks into a loop.

Dr. F██████: And did D█████'s mental state continue to degenerate
after this?

PoI-25053: Yes. I don't know what was happening in there, but
something to do with the train was causing D█████ stress and pain. I
figured something bad had happened to the train. The man that did
this, he told me that the train needed to roam free, D█████'s
creativity was important and anything stopping the train could be
harmful to him. Do you know what they did to it?

Dr. F██████: I'm afraid I can't disclose that information.

PoI-25053: Please. I don't really even know who you are. Or who you
work for, I couldn't really care less to be honest. All I want is for
my son to have a relatively care-free life. He's worked so hard to get
to this point, but it's only getting worse and I feel so horrible for
him.

Dr. F██████ converses with the research team through an earpiece for
46 seconds.

Dr. F██████: Alright. From what we have gathered in this interview, it
is clear your interests are solely for your son.

PoI-25053: I'd hope so

Dr. F██████: We are the SCP Foundation. We are responsible for the
securing, containment and protection of anomalous phenomena. Things
that don't abide by normal logic, or normal physics.

PoI-25053: So like aliens?

Dr. F██████: I can neither confirm nor deny that, but that would be
the correct line of thinking. We can take a look at relaxing the
containment procedures for SCP-4945-B.

PoI-25053: For what?

Dr. F██████: The train.

PoI-25053: Really! Thank you so, so much.

Dr. F██████: The conditions are that you and your son will be held
here and will have to live here for as long as your son is anomalous.
We will have psychiatrists on deck for D█████ and you if required.

PoI-25053: Thank you. Just please, let him have a normal life. As
normal as possible in a place that keeps things like him. He hasn't
done anything for this to happen to him, it really isn't his fault.

Dr. F██████: We know. That's why you will be kept here as well as a
Person of Interest. At a later date, you will be questioned about the
individual you mentioned, for now, the guards will escort you and your
son to your new living quarters.

Afterword: Investigations into the individual2 mentioned by PoI-25053
are ongoing. PoI-25053 shall be kept on site with SCP-4945-A.
SCP-4945-A's identity is to be redacted from all documentation, to
protect it. Special Containment Procedures must be amended to allow
SCP-4945-B to roam free within reason. Current priorities are to allow
SCP-4945-A to live as normally as possible both for ease of
containment and for its development through childhood.



Footnotes

1. As SCP-4945-A's level of focus goes up, SCP-4945-B increases in
speed and materialises fewer instances of SCP-4945-B-1.

2. Designated PoI-01097
