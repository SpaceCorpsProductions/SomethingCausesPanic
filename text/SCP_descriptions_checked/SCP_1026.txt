Item #: SCP-1026 

Object Class: Euclid (see Addendum #1026-1) 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1026 is contained within a 8 m x 8 m 
unfurnished room. Personnel are advised not to enter SCP-1026's containment cell 
without supervision from an external observer. SCP-1026 is contained within a 
reinforced cell in Sector ██. Under no circumstances are any personnel to 
enter the containment area; all observation will be done remotely through 
security cameras with a broadcast delay of no less than 13.6 seconds. No care is 
necessary; SCP-1026 has no apparent need for food, water, or sleep. 

Description: SCP-1026 is an entity that produces a powerful mental effect on any 
human observer who views it directly. This effect causes observers to become 
completely convinced that SCP-1026 is someone who they know and trust, typically 
a family member or close friend. There is currently no known way to convince the 
observer otherwise; this effect will continue for approximately one (1) hour 
after they are removed from SCP-1026's presence (subjects that lack any close 
relationships, such as sociopaths, appear to be unable to see SCP-1026 and 
refuse to acknowledge its existence). This effect is present even when viewed 
indirectly, such as through camera feeds, although this effect can be mitigated 
by the presence of a long enough broadcast delay. Testing has revealed that a 
minimum of 13.6 seconds is required to neutralize SCP-1026's effect; when viewed 
in such a manner, or through other media such as photographs, SCP-1026 appears 
as a blurry, roughly humanoid entity. It appears to "flicker", rapidly changing 
height, shape, and color. SCP-1026 seems to be capable of speech; however, this 
speech sounds extremely garbled and distorted to those not under its anomalous 
effects. Those who are under its effects perceive it as perfectly normal human 
speech appropriate for the given situation. SCP-1026 has also displayed 
reasoning and problem-solving abilities on par with those of a human, as well as 
a fairly docile temperament (see Addendum #1026-1). 


Addendum #1026-1: 

The following log is an account of a test to determine the exact nature of 
SCP-1026's abilities, performed just prior to Incident 1026-1. On 
██/██/██ D-5582 was told to enter the testing area and perform a 
series of experiments to gather information about SCP-1026's physiology. Dr. 
█████ oversaw the test and communicated with D-5582 through a speaker. 

- Level 3 Clearance Required 

- Access Granted 

[BEGIN LOG] 

*D-5582 enters test chamber carrying video camera* 

D-5582: What the hell? There's someone else in here! 

Dr. █████: Yes there is. Please proceed. 

D-5582: Oh my- Mom? That's my [expletive] mother, you bastards! What the hell is 
this?! 

Dr. █████: That is not your mother. Please proceed with the test. 

SCP-1026: *garbled speech* 

D-5582: Don't worry, Mom. I'm gonna get us outta here. (to speaker) Let her out 
now! 

Dr. █████: That is not your mother. Please proceed with the- 

D-5582: [Expletive] the test! I'm not doing anything until you tell me what the 
hell's going on! 

SCP-1026: *garbled speech* 

D-5582: I don't know, Mom. That's what I'm trying to find out. 

*D-5582 throws a piece of equipment at speaker; misses* 

D-5582: [Expletive] you! [Expletive] you all! *begins crying* 

Dr. █████: *sighs* D-5582, the test is now terminated please leave the 
chamber. 

*SCP-1026 begins to move towards D-5582* 

D-5582: I'm not leaving my mother! 

Dr. █████: If you do not vacate the test chamber, I will be forced to 
call security! 

*SCP-1026 is now standing behind D-5582* 

Dr. █████: I'm going to tell you one last time… 

*SCP-1026 appears to grab D-5582's shoulders, spin him around, and "stare" at 
his face* 

Dr. █████: I-I need a security team down here now! 

*D-5582 begins to violently convulse, and his body begins to "flicker" in a 
manner similar to that of SCP-1026* 

Dr. █████: Oh Jesus… There's two of them… 

*SCP-1026 and D-5582 move towards test chamber door as security team enters* 

[END LOG] 

After the above log was created, SCP-1026 and D-5582 broke containment. 
Displaying unusually aggressive behavior, they proceeded to kill █ members of 
the security team and wound ██ more. The security teams found it very 
difficult to respond due to SCP-1026's mental effect. Although one of the 
entities (now assigned the designation of SCP-1026-A) was lured into a temporary 
holding cell and re-contained, the whereabouts of SCP-1026-B are unknown (see 
Addendum #1026-2). 

Note: Shit. These things can reproduce… If there's more of them out there, we 
could have a serious problem on our hands. -Dr. █████ 


- Access Granted 

Addendum #1026-2: 

On ██/██/██, SCP-1026-B was located two miles from Sector ██, 
where SCP-1026-A is currently being held (how it managed to cover the distance 
between the original facility and Sector ██ is currently unknown). A 
security team was dispatched to contain it. [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in the 
accidental neutralization of SCP-1026-B. Dr. █████ performed an 
autopsy of the entity on ██/██/██ (see Document 1026-B). 


Document 1026-B

Autopsy Report of SCP-1026-B

After the accidental neutralization of SCP-1026-B, its body seemingly
lost its anomalous properties, appearing to be a normal human cadaver
(identified as D-5582). Dr. ███████ requested permission to perform an
autopsy on the entity. The following report is an audio log recorded
during the autopsy.

[BEGIN LOG]

Dr. ███████: The date is ██/██/██. This is Dr. ███████, performing an
autopsy on the body of SCP-1026-B, which was killed [DATA EXPUNGED]. I
will begin by making an incision in the subject's abdomen.

*25-second gap*

Dr. ███████: I have just completed the first incision into the
subject's abdomen. I can see no internal organs aside from a single
large sac attached to the subject's vertebrae. I am attempting to open
it…

*19-second gap*

Dr. ███████: The sac is full of… fog, for lack of a better word. It
appears to be much denser than air, as it's not flowing upwards. I'm
taking a sample of it for later analysis.

*21-second gap*

Dr. ███████: I am now attempting to open the subject's thoracic
cavity.

*64-second gap*

Dr. ███████: Subject does not appear to possess a normal thoracic
cage… Instead, there are two curved plates attached to the spinal
column in its place. There appears to be a pair of organs beneath
these. I will attempt to remove them.

*69-second gap*

Dr. ███████: The organs appear to be solid; I see no sign of any fluid
or gas inside. I'm taking a sample for later analysis, and will then
attempt to examine the skull.

*276-second gap*

Dr. ███████: The skull appears to be abnormally smooth. Cranial
sutures are absent, as is the nasal cavity and most other topological
features. The eye sockets are present, but lack optic canals and
orbital fissures. The jaw… appears to be fused to the rest of the
skull, and there are no teeth. I'm going to attempt to access the
brain cavity now.

*150-second gap*

Dr. ███████: The brain is entirely absent. The interior of the skull
seems to be full of "fog" similar to that found in the abdominal
organ. I'm going to take another sample.

*10-second gap*

Dr. ███████: Sorry about that. When I attempted take a sample, the
"fog" began glowing… I'm going to try again.

*6-second gap*

Dr. ███████: Just a minute… I've got a headache all of the sudden…

*12-second gap*

Dr. ███████: Jesus Christ, this hurts… What the-?

[END LOG]

The log was ended due to an unexpected loss of power in the autopsy
room. When a security team entered, they saw no sign that an autopsy
had taken place. SCP-1026-B's body was intact, and Dr. ███████ claimed
to have no memory of what had happened. A subsequent autopsy revealed
that SCP-1026-B possessed normal human physiology and no anomalous
properties whatsoever.
