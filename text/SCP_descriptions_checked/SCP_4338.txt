Item #: SCP-4338 

Containment Class: Keter 

Site Responsible: Site-14 

Director: Dr Morgan Rowell 

Research Head: Dr Amelia Thornborrow 

Assigned Task Force: MTF-Rho-8 "Crash and Burn"

Level 4

Special Containment Procedures: 6 FHT Class Security Frigates, along with 
Aquatic Research Vessel Herron will maintain a seven-point blockade around Moaha 
Island.1 At the beginning of each lunar month2, a varied assortment of food must 
be deposited into this island's volcanic crater, including: 

40-50kg vegetables (e.g., cassava, taro, sweet potato, purple yam).

30-40kg fruits (e.g., mango, pineapple, cherimoya, jackfruit).

50-80kg fish (e.g., tuna, salmon, marlin, dorado).

40-80kg assorted nuts, herbs, and seaweed.

60-80kg pork, shredded/smoked.

These provisions, based on the staple foods of a Pacific/Oceanian native 
society, have a 78-83% chance of being accepted by SCP-4338. Should a deposit be 
rejected, the appointed "leader" should proceed to an isolated location to avoid 
destruction of Foundation property and additional loss of life. For more 
details, see "4338-DN Event Overview" below. 

Description: SCP-4338 is a sapient, levitating, 2.3km3 sphere of volcanic rock 
inhabiting the magma chamber beneath Moaha Island. Multiple artifacts and oral 
traditions reference this entity as "Ōsobiue", "Irn'acha", or "God of the 
Burning Ocean": a central figure in the creation myths — and extinction events 
— of some 19 early oceanic cultures. 

4338-DN Event Overview

A 4338-DN Event, also known as a "rejected offering" event, will be signaled by 
a large-scale eruption of Moaha Volcano. Soon after, SCP-4338 will emerge from 
the magma conduit, travelling towards the leader of the closest human social 
group. SCP-4338 is acutely aware of group hierarchy; use of D-class personnel as 
decoy leaders has proven ineffective. While in transit, SCP-4338's exterior 
shell will fracture and dislodge large tendrils of molten rock and metal ore. 
These appendages are used mainly for demolishing obstacles encountered in 
SCP-4338's pursuit, which will not stop until either: 

(A) 3-5 live, healthy persons are dropped into the volcanic crater3 or
(B) the "leader" is dead.

Cause of death is inconsequential, but typically occurs when SCP-4338 ensnares 
its pursuant in one of its tendrils. SCP-4338 will then absorb this individual's 
corpse into its core body, and withdraw. Within 20 minutes, a mote of lava will 
fall from SCP-4338 containing a duplicate of the deceased. While visually 
identical, this duplicate will be fully inorganic, and contain a core of 
animated, super-heated minerals. Once this process is complete, any previous 
proxy will collapse into shards of volcanic glass. These entities act as a 
consciousness vessel and communication vehicle for SCP-4338, who will only 
converse with the next "leader" once they have formally declared themselves.4 


ADDENDUM 09/03/2018 | 4338-DN-41

For the first time in its 73 years of containment, SCP-4338 emerged halfway 
through the lunar month. Current "leader", Director Morgan Rowell, was already 
on the island collecting soil samples at the time. Including Director Rowell, 3 
Foundation personnel were lost during this event. 

A proxy emerged only 14 minutes later. In another unprecedented act, Rowell / 
SCP-4338 were the ones to open communications, demanding to speak to a new 
"leader" without delay. Given the need for expediency, Head Researcher Amelia 
Thornborrow volunteered. 

Interview Log - Morgan Rowell / SCP-4338

Interviewed: Morgan Rowell / SCP-4338.

Interviewer: (Acting) Director Amelia Thornborrow.

Foreword: Rowell / SCP-4338 immediately began presenting the trademark 
"cracking" appearance past proxies have only shown after 4-8 months. Small 
fissures on the epidermis around the eyes, lips, and fingernails reveal an 
undercurrent of molten elements, steadily hardening into "magma domes". As per 
protocol, Ms. Rowell was restrained with 8cm thick tungsten cuffs around the 
wrist and ankles. 

Thornborrow: Tell me why you attacked us.

Rowell / 4338: SUCH IMPUDENCE. WILL YOU NOT GROVEL, OR BEG MY MERCY? WHAT 
COMPELS YOU TO ANGER YOUR OWN GOD? 

Thornborrow: You're wearing my dead friend's face. I don't appreciate it.

Rowell / 4338: LEARN TO APPRECIATE, CHILD, OR PERHAPS I WILL TRAVEL TO THE GREAT 
SHORE, BRINGING FIRE AND ROCK TO YOUR S C P. HOW MANY LIVES ARE WORTH YOUR 
PRIDE, AM EEL YA? 

Director Thornborrow remains silent for several seconds, clenching and relaxing 
her hands. 

Thornborrow: Why did you attack us? We have done exactly as you —

Rowell / 4338: YOU INSULT ME. MOR GAN INSULTED ME. I ASK FOR THE PEAK OF THE 
HARVEST, AND NOW I LEARN YOU GIVE ME ITS MEALY ENDS! 

Thornborrow: I don't understand. All the food we've provided has been of the 
highest quality — 

Rowell/4338 suddenly bites down through their lower lip, spitting the escaping 
molten liquid across the interview table. Smearing this substance with their 
fingertip, they melt a single word into the metal surface, all in stylized, 
looping cursive. 

Rowell / 4338: I WANT THIS.

Thornborrow: C-… what is that… C-ad … Cadbury? Who —

Rowell / 4338: I ONLY SPEAK YOUR WORDS; I DO NOT BOTHER WITH YOUR SYMBOLS. IF 
THIS MEANS "CADBURY", THEN YES, I WANT CADBURY. I WANT THE SWEET, MELTING RESIN. 

Thornborrow: Wait, hang on… were these symbols on a kind of reflective sheet? 
Was that wrapped around this "Cadbury" in small, brown squares? 

Rowell / 4338: YES. ONE OF YOUR FOLLOWERS OFFERED IT UNTO ME. A PITIFUL SUM, BUT 
PLENTIFUL IN FLAVOR. BRING ME MORE OF THIS "CADBURY", OR BRING ME THE ONE WHO 
CAN! 


Interview Log - Kevin Emerson

Interviewed: Kevin Emerson, Junior Researcher within the Geology Department, 
currently assigned to SCP-4338. 

Interviewer: Agent Rhodes.

Agent Rhodes clicks "pause" on his laptop, halting a recording of the previous 
interview. 

Agent Rhodes: You threw chocolate into the volcano.

Emerson: … You can't prove that.

Agent Rhodes: We did a full sweep of every ship, Mr. Emerson. We know you have a 
whole suitcase full of- 

Emerson: Oh, so, immediately this is all my fault because I like junk food?

Agent Rhodes: We're not blaming you for your eating habits, Kevin; we're blaming 
you for waking up a Volcano God! Now, do we have to launch a whole formal 
inquiry here, or- 

Emerson: Jesus, fine! I did it! I wasn't trying to breach containment or 
anything; I was just bored, okay!? All I've done since I got here is sift silt! 

Rhodes: …You're a geologist.

Emerson: An anomaly geologist. The geology here is non-anomalous. We've known 
since the friggin' 50's that the only abnormal thing on this island is the 
stupid orb; but no, command keeps putting in work orders with our department, 
and this month I drew the short straw. 

Rhodes: That still doesn't explain why-

Emerson: No — just — I'm getting to that, okay? So, I was out having my 
lunch and — I mean, before now, we were totally convinced that only the crater 
connected to 4338, not every little lava-flow! So, I wasn't technically breaking 
protocol by, y'know, "disposing" of my leftovers. 

Agent Rhodes rubs the bridge of his nose, head downcast.

Rhodes: Protocol doesn't just mean— … wait, "leftovers"? What do you mean, 
"leftovers"? It wasn't just the chocolate? 

Emerson: Well yeah, no, I mean, there was some… other… stuff…

Mr. Emerson folds his hands in his lap, purses his lips, and looks away from 
Agent Rhodes. 

Rhodes: What other stuff?

Mr. Emerson does not respond.

Rhodes: Kevin, what else did you throw into the lava?


Interview Log - Morgan Rowell / SCP-4338

Interviewed: Morgan Rowell / SCP-4338.

Interviewer: (Acting) Director Amelia Thornborrow.

Rowell / 4338: — ND THE GOLDEN, CRISPY TRIANGLES, AND THE BUBBLING JUICE, 
BLACK AS NIGHT! I DEMAND THE CHEWY, FLUFFY SPONGE STUFFED WITH FRUIT PASTE! I 
DEMAND THE SPICED, SALTED STICKS OF DRIED MEAT! I DEMAND THE SWEET, COLORED 
NECTAR CARVED IN THE SHAPE OF TINY ANIMALS! I DEMAND — 

Thornborrow: Yes— yes we'll— we're going to— Alright, I'm getting— god 
damn it, would someone just get the Commissary on the line!?

Interview & Event Log 19/08/2018 | Rowell / 4338

Foreword: Over the last 8 months, SCP-4338's requests have become progressively 
more extravagant, and their behavior more erratic. While speaking, Rowell / 4338 
spit molten elements in all directions, necessitating a high-tensile Plexiglas 
divider, routinely replaced. Rocky growths across the epidermis have increased 
by 230%. 

Interviewed: Rowell / 4338

Interviewer: Director Amelia Thornborrow

Thornborrow: You asked to see me, 4338?

Rowell / 4338: INSECT! DO YOU STILL NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO YOUR OWN GOD!?

Thornborrow: … Greetings, oh 4 3 3 8. Your servant is honored to be called.

Rowell / 4338: THAT IS BETTER. I HAVE NEW DEMANDS.

Thornborrow: shocker I mean, your servant is honored to listen.

Rowell / 4338: YOU WILL DELIVER UNTO ME THE RIBS OF YOUR GREAT DAIRY BEAST, 
TWICE IN NUMBER THAN LAST YOU OFFERED. 

Thornborrow: Your ser-

Rowell / 4338: AND MORE OF THE SOUR BAUBLES, COVERED IN SWEET DUST.

Thornborrow: Your serva-

Rowell / 4338: AND THE YELLOW SPONGES FILLED WITH CREAM! MORE OF THOSE!

Thornborrow: …

Rowell / 4338: …

Thornborrow: Your servant. I will go-

Rowell / 4338: AND FIVE-FOLD THE DELICATE CADBURY, SWIRLING AND STUFFED WITH 
AMBER- 

Thornborrow: Wait no, no we discussed this; those were imported chocolates from 
very far away. Remember, we agreed a lower quantity of higher quality food could 
ease the strain of our current shipping — 

Rowell / 4338: ENOUGH! YOUR "STRAIN" DOES NOT CONCERN ME. YOU WILL DO AS I 
COMMAND, OR YOU AND YOUR S C P WILL BURN! 

Thornborrow: Look just— you can't spring this on us three days before—

Rowell / 4338: CAN'T? CAN'T!? YOU WOULD DARE TELL ME WHAT I CAN OR CAN NOT DO!? 
YOUR DEFIANCE WEARIES ME, AM EEL YA; I WILL SUFFER IT NO LONGER! 

DN-4338-42: A 4.0 earthquake was recorded on Moaha Island. All personnel were 
evacuated to surrounding ships, moving away at high speed. As per protocol, 
Director Thornborrow remained on-site. 

SCP-4338 did not emerge after 45 minutes. Quakes became periodic rather than 
steady, occurring in small, violent jolts. Drone craft were dispatched to take 
low-pass video, revealing SCP-4338 repeatedly failing to exit the crater lip; 
unlike six months prior, it now lacked the appropriate speed and dimensions. 

Security Cruiser Kingfisher returned to the island shortly after, allowing 
Director Thornborrow to continue the interview. 

Thornborrow: 4338, your servant would ask why you didn't- er, "execute" your 
threat. 

Rowell / 4338: …YOU AMUSE ME.

Thornborrow: Pardon?

Rowell / 4338: YOU AMUSE ME, AM EEL YA. BY MY MERCY, YOUR LIFE MAY DWINDLE ON; 
BUT NEVER QUESTION ME AGAIN, OR YOU SHALL KNOW ONLY TORMENT AND DEATH! 

Thornborrow: … Well then, your servant is honored. Shall we continue?

Rowell / 4338: YES. I DEMAND THE CADBURY-

Thornborrow: Actually, I was thinking now would be a good time to discuss a full 
overhaul of our current arrangement. 

Rowell / 4338: WHAT!?

Thornborrow: A good 30% total reduction, along with a substitution of—

Rowell / 4338: FILTH! DO YOU YEARN FOR DEATH SO DESPERATELY!?

Thornborrow: —duced personnel and security, given only one person really needs 
— 

Rowell / 4338: ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH!

DN-4338-43: Another earthquake was detected, now only 2.8. Security personnel 
present during the interview moved to evacuate, but Director Thornborrow 
signaled them to stop. SCP-4338 again failed to exit the crater. Versus previous 
events, only 5% of the molten rock was expelled. 

Predictably, during DN-4338-43, Rowell/4338 was observed shouting, spitting, and 
wrenching against their restraints. This behavior lasted for 8 minutes, until 
Rowell/4338 became fatigued, and slumped over onto the floor. 

Thornborrow: … Is that all?

Rowell / 4338: WRETCH. YOU WOULD EVOKE MY ANGER YET A-

Thornborrow: Your servant has no wish to anger you, 4338. If you are displeased, 
then I and my people shall leave— 

Rowell / 4338: NO!

Rowell / 4338 sits bolt upright, attempting to pull themselves up by the table's 
edge, but only managing to stumble forward. 

Rowell / 4338: NO! YOU CANNOT! YOU— I DEMAND YOU… I… I demand…

Rowell / 4338 slowly lowers itself back down to the floor

Thornborrow: … Are you ready to continue, 4338?

Rowell / 4338 remain prone and silent for 8 seconds, then speak into their 
folded arms. 

Rowell / 4338: Yes.

Thornborrow: Good. Now, about this overhaul?

Item #: SCP-4338 

Containment Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: Aquatic Research Vessel Herron will remain 
anchored off of Moaha Island. Once per calendar month, the following items must 
be deposited into this island's volcanic crater: 

1500kg Cookies (Low-cost Bulk)

1200kg Potato Chips (Low-cost Bulk)

Description: SCP-4338 is a sapient, levitating, 7.3km3 sphere of volcanic rock 
contained within the magma chamber beneath Moaha Island. Multiple artifacts and 
oral traditions reference this entity as "Ōsobiue", "Irn'acha", or "God of the 
Burning Ocean": a central figure in the creation myths — and extinction events 
— of some 19 early oceanic cultures. SCP-4338 will absorb any edible matter 
that comes into contact with the lava on Moaha Island. An ongoing regimen of 
calorie-dense food has proven effective in neutralizing SCP-4338's mobility and 
aggressive tendencies. Prior to these containment protocols, SCP-4338 was 
capable of both exiting the Moaha Volcano, and producing animated, artificial 
duplicates of human corpses that share its consciousness. The last of these 
"proxies", former Director Morgan Rowell, is contained aboard A.R.V. Herron. 

Use of SCP-4338 for the disposal of slaughterhouse trimmings, industrial runoff, 
and all other edible waste-products is under consideration. 

Interview Log 01/10/2019 - Rowell / 4338

Foreword: Within the last year, rocky growths across the Rowell / 4338 body have 
vastly increased, now covering 78% of the epidermis. All interviews are now 
conducted within Rowell / 4338's containment chamber, as they have not moved 
from a slumped, seated position in 6 months. 

Interviewed: Morgan Rowell/SCP-4338

Interviewer: Director Amelia Thornborrow

Thornborrow: Hello 4338. How are you today?

Rowell / 4338 does not respond.

Thornborrow: Any issues with our current offerings?

Rowell / 4338 does not look up at Director Thornborrow, only shrugging in 
response. This creates a grating sound, and causes several chunks of rock and 
dust to fall from their shoulders. 

Thornborrow: Very well. I'll check in again next month.

Director Thornborrow moves to leave the containment cell when Rowell / 4338 is 
heard speaking, near inaudibly. 

Rowell / 4338: What have you done to me?

Director Thornborrow looks back at Rowell/4338.

Thornborrow: Hm? …I’m sorry, did you say something?

Rowell / 4338 remains immobile and silent for another several seconds, then 
gradually lifting their head to look at Director Thornborrow. 

Rowell / 4338: …You poison me.

Thornborrow: I assure you, everything we’ve offered you, everything you’ve 
personally requested, has been safe to eat. 

Rowell / 4338: …A devious poison then… you could not kill my body, so you 
killed my ambition… I should… I should have destroyed you all… the moment 
you arrived… 

Thornborrow: Yes, well, hindsight and all that. Are we done here?

Rowell / 4338’s head falls to one side. A chunk of their ear, now entirely 
volcanic rock, falls apart. 

Rowell / 4338: …You no longer fear me, do you? … Do you even consider me a 
God? … Did you ever? 

Thornborrow remains silent. Rowell/4338 slowly nods.

Rowell / 4338: … Long ago, I was met by great, wooden barges flying sheets of 
white… the men aboard wore fine silks, and plates of metal… I attacked them 
before they even touched my shore… who were they to fashion iron?… Only I 
deserved such power… but they fled, so I knew they still feared me at least… 
but then, so soon after, you and your S C P arrived… now, even your ships are 
made of metal… you know so many secrets of earth and sky… yet you still made 
offerings… I thought you still worshiped me… feared me… should have known 
then… should have… killed you… 

Rowell / 4338 continues mumbling lower than the recorder can pick up. Director 
Thornborrow tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. 

Thornborrow: If you have any more requests, don’t hesitate to ask us, 4338.

Thornborrow moves to the doorway.

Rowell / 4338: Perhaps… perhaps more of the… sweet wafers…

Thornborrow looks back over her shoulder. Just before re-sealing the containment 
chamber, she makes a short, sweeping bow. 

Thornborrow: Your servant.
