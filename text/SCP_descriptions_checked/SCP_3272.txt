Item #: SCP-3272 

Object Class: Safe 

Special Containment Procedures: Foundation agents embedded within all major 
space programs are to coordinate the suppression of evidence of SCP-3272. 
Amateur astronomy communities are to be monitored for any possible reports of 
SCP-3272 activity, with particular attention being paid to individuals known to 
have access to telescopes with a resolution of 0.02 or fewer arc-seconds. 

Presently, no instances of SCP-3272 have survived atmospheric reentry, and thus 
require no active containment efforts. 

Description: SCP-3272 is a series of human corpses that lay scattered along 
Earth's orbital trajectory. These corpses will inevitably reenter Earth's 
atmosphere unless otherwise interfered with. Outside of originating from outer 
space, these corpses are believed to be non-anomalous. Since initial discovery 
on 3 September 2053 by the Keck 1 telescope crew, 13 instances have been 
confirmed to have reentered Earth's atmosphere. 

Efforts to recover an instance of SCP-3272 are ongoing.

LEVEL 2/3272

CLASSIFIED

Item #: SCP-3272

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Due to security concerns, SCP-3272 is
to be stored in a Faraday cage at Site-48. The hermetic seal within
SCP-3272 is not to be breached under any circumstances.

The whereabouts of PoI-2658 are currently under investigation. They
are to be apprehended for interrogation and subsequent amnestization.

Description: SCP-3272 is a standard-configuration portable toilet that
has presumably been modified by PoI-2658 to be repurposed as a
temporal displacement device. The tank has been retrofitted to contain
various electronic components and is hermetically sealed. The left
interior panel displays a touch screen which allows the user to select
the exact magnitude of time they would like to traverse, and the door
lock mechanism has been repurposed to activate the device. When the
lock is toggled, all foreign matter that currently exists within
SCP-3272 is immediately transported to the specified time. This effect
is repeatable and, to the Foundation's knowledge, consistent. It is
theorized that SCP-3272 does not alter the current timeline, but
rather induces a closed timelike curve (CTC): it is incapable of
altering the past, present, or future of baseline reality.

SCP-3272 was discovered in Pasadena, California after an anonymous tip
to local authorities led to the raid of a storage unit that was rented
out by Brian Monette (PoI-2658), a 33 year old electrochemical
engineer and physicist with a PhD thesis on special relativity. Inside
the unit was a workbench, a cash register filled with $8,357.23, a
drawer filled with 43 handwritten receipts, a brief typed manual
explaining the basic operations and functions of SCP-3272, and the
object itself.

Addendum 3272-A: Test Log

Test 3272-1	

Test Subject

A six-sided die

Procedure

The die was placed within SCP-3272 and the destination was set as 5
seconds in the past. The door was closed and the lock was engaged.

Results

Upon the conclusion of the test, the die was no longer inside of
SCP-3272.
 

Test 3272-2	

Test Subject

A six-sided die

Procedure

The die was placed within SCP-3272 and the destination was set as 5
seconds in the future. The door was closed and the lock was engaged.

Results

Upon the conclusion of the test, the die was no longer inside of
SCP-3272.
 

Test 3272-3	

Test Subject

A six-sided die

Procedure

The die was placed within SCP-3272 and the destination was set as one
picosecond in the past. The door was closed and the lock was engaged.

Results

As the lever to SCP-3272 was closed, the eastern wall of the testing
chamber experienced a high-velocity impact. Embedded in the concrete
was the remains of a six-sided die.
 

Test 3272-4	

Test Subject

D-5820

Procedure

D-5820 entered SCP-3272 and the destination was set as fifteen seconds
in the past. The door was closed and the lock was engaged.

Results

Upon the conclusion of the test, the subject was no longer inside of
SCP-3272. A human corpse was seen re-entering Earth's atmosphere at
approximately the same time that Test 3272-4 was conducted.
