Description: SCP-4318 is a currently unknown phenomenon wherein individuals will 
disappear and reappear, often dead. The most striking feature of individuals 
that return is the total evacuation of water of the body. The exact aspects of 
this occurrence are currently being researched. 

Once found, missing individuals will have their blood replaced with an as yet 
unknown anomalous substance, along with other structural changes. For the 
complete list of structural changes please refer to Document-4318-17. 

The origin and full depth of SCP-4318 is currently unknown, nevertheless, some 
researchers theorize that SCP-4318 incidents are extraversal in nature. 

SCP-4318 has only recently started to occur so a full assessment has yet to be 
decided, however, Lead Researcher Calvin A.M. Demos has begun testing on the 
original location of the SCP-4318 phenomenon and is expected to begin on May 
9th, 2019.
