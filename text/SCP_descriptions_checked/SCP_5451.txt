Item #: SCP-5451 

Level 2

Containment Class: Safe 

Disruption Class: DARK

Risk Class: Notice

RESTRICTED

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5451-2A instances are to be stored in a 
standard containment locker. No animals of the family Spheniscidae are allowed 
to make contact with the advertisements. SCP-5451-2B instances found to have 
memetic effects are to be blocked by Foundation Web Crawler Πουλί . All 
materials released by SCP-5451 is to be disseminated as Foundation Cover R621 
("Online Roleplay"). In addition, a Foundation web crawler is to track the posts 
and conversations of SCP-5451-1 instances to detect any anomalous activity. 

Description: SCP-5451 is a virtual school primarily attended by animals in the 
family Spheniscidae, more commonly known as penguins. Hosted on the site 
penguinschool.aq, students interact with teachers through voice chat along with 
assignments sent through messaging programs. 

SCP-5451-1 are a group of sentient, English-speaking penguins that can access 
the internet through anomalous means. Communication with other SCP-5451-1 
instances are done through a forum on the site forum.penguinschool.aq. 
Non-anomalous penguins turn into SCP-5451-1 instances when they come into 
contact with advertisements made by previous SCP-5451-1 instances. These 
memetically enhanced advertisements (henceforth referred to as SCP-5451-2) come 
in two forms, banner ads or flyers, SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B respectively. 

SCP-5451-2A instances are flyers composed of feathers that are covered in urea. 
They are found in penguin mating spots after mating season. Penguins that come 
into contact with SCP-5451-2A turn into an SCP-5451-1 instance. After one 
academic year, they are enrolled in SCP-5451. 

SCP-5451-2B instances are banner ads found on the Internet. They take the format 
of a penguin on the foreground along with the text "(common name of a penguin) 
Penguin School, the best University in the country!", or some variation of the 
text. Subjects that come into contact with an SCP-5451-2B instance have a 25% 
chance of contributing to penguin conservation efforts using the forums. 


Addendum 1.1: Attempted Interview with SCP-5451-1 instances

On 2021/02/01, Junior Researcher Cook was assigned to arrange an interview on 
the SCP-5451-1 instances to gather general information about SCP-5451 and 
SCP-5451-2

Hello, I'm a new student here, and I really really want to learn more about your 
school, the history behind it, how's the culture here, what are the great stuff 
to be found here and other stuff.

Addendum 1.3: Information about SCP-54512

Under the guise of a school project, Junior Researcher Cook interviews an 
SCP-5451-1 instance about the nature of SCP-5451-2 instances

You're part of the group who makes the advertisements, right?

3rd Year

Yep! I'm from Marketing, that's what we do :D

Addendum 1.4: Culture of SCP-5451-1 Instances

To learn more about the culture of SCP-5451-1 instances, Junior Researcher Cook, 
under the username "beep beep lettuce", interviews multiple SCP-5451-1 instances 
under the guise of a school project over multiple months. After 10 months, 
Junior Researcher Cook publishes a paper entitled The Culture of SCP-5451: A 
VIew Into the Life of Anomalous Penguins Through an Online School. An excerpt of 
the paper is available below along with an excerpt of the interviews done by 
Junior Researcher Cook on SCP-5451-1 instances. 

A copy of the full paper and interview log can be received from either Junior 
Researcher Cook or Senior Researcher Drake. 

- Culture of SCP-5451-1 Instances

1. Family Life

SCP-5451-1 instances have a close-knit relationship with their family, not 
unlike non-anomalous penguins, despite having the mannerisms of non-anomalous 
humans. In a sense, their relationship with their family is like a fusion 
between non-anomalous humans and penguins. 

SCP-5451-1 instances have a noticeably close relationship with even their 
cousins thrice removed, as most of them live together in packs, like 
non-anomalous penguins. However, when it comes time for SCP-5451-1 to leave 
their house to start their own lineage, they are given a copy of a recipe that 
both their mother and father made. 

In fact, it is a rite of passage for an SCP-5451-1 instances to cook their first 
meal without the assistance of their parents. 

A marriage proposal between two SCP-5451-1 instances consists of cooking a 
traditional recipe from their families and presenting their meal to the 
bride/groom. 

Due to their food recipes being passed down from generation to generation, 
SCP-5451-1 instances take great pride in their lineage. 

Being a cook is considered to be the highest honor among SCP-5451-1 instances, 
and recreating their families' dishes while adding their own touch is considered 
to be one of the important things parent SCP-5451-1 instances must teach to 
their children. 

2. Cuisine

Although mainly inspired by American cuisine, the recipes made by SCP-5451-1 
instances noticeably have fish in them, with some seaweed mixed in for umami. 
Most of the dishes SCP-54511 instances call "traditional" are Inuit recipes, 
suggesting a link between Inuit culture and SCP-5451-1 instances. In addition, 
most traditional SCP-5451-1 dishes involve some sort of food preservation 
technique, whether that be fermentation or drying food. 

Due to globalization, other methods of cooking food has reached the SCP-5451-1 
instances. This has developed their cuisine so much, younger SCP-5451-1 
instances are having a hard time developing their own recipes due to the amount 
of methods possible. 

Some notable food preparation methods that SCP-5451-1 traditionally use are:

Fermentation of fishes

Freezing of fishes to be eaten raw

Drying of seaweed under the sun for consumption

Smoking

Daily Topic Thread: Favorite Food? (page 5/7)

You really eat frozen fish? No cooking?


3rd Year

Yep! It's true man, I swear!
Don't you eat your fish frozen and raw?

4th Year

it's delicious.

Hello guys, Forster here.

Due to the lack of students enrolling in our school, the budget for our forum

Hello guys, Forster here.

Unfortunately, despite all our efforts, the forums will have to be closed, for 
we were not able to gather enough money to keep the servers up. 

Don't worry about losing those forum threads, though. They will be archived and 
kept as they are. 

Again, thank you for all the memories, experiences, and threads you all have 
made here. I never would've imagined that this simple forum between staff will 
grow to have such a tight-knit community. 

Thank you for everything, and as the great Douglas Adams say,
"So long, and thanks for all the fish"
