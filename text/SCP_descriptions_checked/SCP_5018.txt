Item #: SCP-5018 

Level 4

Containment Class: Euclid 

Disruption Class: VLAM

Risk Class: Critical

SECRET

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5018 is contained within an air-gapped 
computer terminal in Site 15. This terminal is physically secured with 
non-electronic locks and is to remain unpowered outside of authorized testing. 
Site 15 AI THEIA is to monitor all Foundation networks for suspicious activity 
fitting SCP-5018's electronic pattern. If discovered, MTF Kappa-10 ("Skynet") 
and MTF Rho-9 ("Technical Support") are to be deployed immediately to isolate 
and purge all instances of SCP-5018. 

Description: SCP-5018 is an advanced self-replicating malware capable of 
releasing reinforced magnetic containment locks1 connected to the Foundation 
network. Analysis of the MCL's indicates that their magnetic field had been 
disrupted2, causing a subsequent repulsion to occur. How SCP-5018 exhibits this 
ability, and the entity which created the program is still under investigation.3 

SCP-5018's execution command initiates once it confirms the presence of specific 
parameters in the affected system. The execution of the code triggers the 
manifestation of SCP-5018-1 within 5 meters of the terminal. 

SCP-5018-1 is an indistinct humanoid figure that can only be observed through 
digitized media and de-manifests when SCP-5018's running code is terminated. 
Although all attempts at verbal communication with SCP-5018-1 have been 
unsuccessful, it has been observed to acknowledge others around it through the 
use of exaggerated body language.4 

SCP-5018 was discovered on 9/15/‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà on the Foundation's network. Probes 
scanning for its digital signature detected that the malware was spread over 74% 
of the Foundation network. Of the detected instances, only approximately 10% of 
them had been executed, with 8% activating in high-security level sites. How 
SCP-5018 gained access into the Foundation network is under investigation. MTF 
Rho-9 has been tasked with its removal.

INCIDENT REPORT 5018.1

Incident Report ID #: 5018-A1

Summary: On 07/19/‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, Site 119 initiated a 119/B/Coldsilver Lockdown 
Response Code following containment breaches of six Large Scale Aggressors, four 
Non-Terminable Threats, and five other extradimensional anomalous threats. O4 
approved the detonation of Site 119's nuclear warhead one hour and thirty-four 
minutes after the Lockdown Response Code was initiated. Site 68 received a 
backup of files, sent by Director David Bold, 26 minutes after the destruction 
of Site 119. Included in the backup was one folder of encrypted files and one 
image taken after the detonation. Following the incident, MTF Epsilon-11 
("Nine-Tailed Fox") was dispatched to establish a perimeter around the affected 
area. 

MTF Œµ-11 was unable to locate any threats after Site 119's detonation. However, 
MTF Œµ-11 reported sightings of 5 unidentified individuals 3 days following Site 
119's destruction. MTF Œµ-11's attempt to apprehend the individuals were 
unsuccessful5. MTF Œµ-11 was immediately relieved by MTF Nu-7 ("Hammer Down") 
and sent to Site 68 for medical treatment and debriefing. 6 weeks after the 
detonation, MTF Omicron-2 ("Nuclear Nomads") was sent to investigate the remains 
of Site 119. 

MTF o-2 discovered 15 compromised MCLs in the remains of Site 119. This incident 
is recorded as the first insertion point of SCP-5018 into the Foundation's 
network infrastructure.

EXPERIMENT LOG 5018.1

Date: 04/03/‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà

Experiment Number : 5018-A

Protocol: SCP-5018 runs on a standard computer terminal.

Results: SCP-5018 remained dormant for approximately one hour before 
replicating. Replication continued as a background task for 30 minutes until 
SCP-5018's code self-terminated. 20 replicates were later discovered in a hidden 
file.6 The terminal was powered off to prevent the spread of these replicates. 

Experiment Number : 5018-B

Protocol: SCP-5018 runs on a standard computer terminal connected to a MCL.7

Results: SCP-5018-1 manifests within the chamber, and is detected by camera feed 
of the chamber. Researchers within the chamber cannot observe SCP-5018-1, 
however, SCP-5018-1 acknowledges their presence by shaking its fists at them, 
then begins to hover over the MCL. 

After 1 minute, SCP-5018-1 de-manifests and the MCL is opened. Results are 
similar to the MCLs in Site 119. A function was later detected running as 
background process. 

Access SCP-5018 Source Code

Experiment Number : 5018-C

Protocol: SCP-5018 runs on a standard computer terminal connected to a motorized 
lock. 

Results: SCP-5018 was unable to access the mechanism. It then proceeded to 
replicate as observed in Experiment 5018-A. Computer terminal was powered off.

Addendum 5018-3

On 03/24/‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà Site 71 reported a containment breach of 2 LSA's and 1 NTT 
following an experiment involving SCP-5018 at Site 15. The containment breach 
was later contained by MTF Rho-9 and resulted in 6 casualties. MTF Rho-9 
discovered an activated sequence of SCP-5018 before the incident, which has been 
included in SCP-5018's documents. 

struct group_info init_groups = { .usage = MAGNET_INIT(4) }:

struct group_info *groups_alloc(int dimensiontrans){

           group info *group_info;

           int nblocks;

           int i;

nblock = (magsetpol + NGROUPS_PER_BLOCK - 1) / NGROUPS_PER BLOCK;

/* Establish points of contact for the entire quadrants, not just a portion. 
Keep intentional files within encrypted folders. Make sure we don't forget 
password. Type it all as one word, look for Access phrases. /* 

nblocks = nblocks ? : 1;

group_info = ketrcont(sizeof(*group_info) + nblocks*sizeof(gid_t *), 
PSWRD_PHRASE = FALL; 

if (!group_info)

            return NULL;

This segment has been concluded to control how SCP-5018 terminates power to an 
electromagnet once it detects a viable MCL. Investigations are ongoing as to the 
other properties that this computer script exhibits, as well as how this 
instance was initiated at Site 71. 

Researcher's Note: On 03/26/‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, after receiving reports of 
unauthorized experimentation, Site Director Norva removed Researcher Argost from 
any projects relating to SCP-5018. An investigation of Researcher Argosts 
experimentation revealed that he was in possession of an encrypted file. 
Foundation webcrawlers are currently decrypting the file, however no information 
has been gathered. Researcher Jak has become the new lead researcher for 
SCP-5018 until otherwise specified.

- Note 1

I was checking over some of SCP-5018's metadata and code today.
Noticed some unusual things about them. For starters, I think the
metadata in the Image Analysis is broken. I can't exactly figure out
why, but some of the information can be seen through the censors.
Guess our guys in the back kind of failed at their jobs. I'm going to
try investigating more.

Figured it out. I just had to hover around sections of the censored
parts to reveal some text. Could only find one thing. How did this get
here? Surely, our guys weren't slacking, right? Well damn. I guess
I'll keep snooping around then.

- Note 2

Alright, so I found something else. This time hiding in the source
code of Experiment 5018-B. Has something to do with the font size of
some of the letters. There aren't numbers or anything, so I think the
order from top to bottom should be correct. What is happening? I don't
get what's going on. It's frustrating. I guess I'll keep looking.

- Note 3

That last one's pretty easy. It's basically written down. How we all
missed that, I'll never understand. I guess, since we weren't actively
looking for something resembling a password, we overlooked it. Oh
well, I should have all the phrases by now. All I have to do now is
type the three words out, hopefully, in the order they're presented
(hopefully there are no spaces in between). But, I can't stop asking
myself, "why?" What's the game, here?

Whatever this is that I'm accessing better tell me something fucking
important, or I'm dropping the hammer on this thing.

Footnotes

1. Colloquially referred to as MCL's. These have been determined to follow a 
specific product code of Item Number: 4510878. Any continued use of these items 
has been terminated for all Sites. 

2. This has been determined to be caused by the malware terminating electrical 
power to electromagnets connected to the MCL. 

3. SCP-5018's source code retrieved from memory dumps during its runtime 
resembles the C programming language. It cannot compile or run in any other 
conditions than during the anomaly's activity. 

4. Refer to Experiment Log 5018-B.

5. Theories suggesting the individuals may have used anomalous objects to 
facilitate in their escape are being investigated. 

6. The host terminal was not connected to any networks. This has been concluded 
to be the cause for the creation of the hidden file. 

7. Now referred to as Standard Procedure.
