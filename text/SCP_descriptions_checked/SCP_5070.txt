Item #: SCP-5070 

Object Class: Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5070 is to at all costs be contained in 
Site-██, surrounded by a 10 metre thick layer of steel, with no way of 
entering through it. 

Any attempts of any sort of interaction with SCP-5070, or entering the 
containment chamber, are grounds for immediate termination without special 
permission from the 05 Council. 

No cameras, or any other way of surveillance that includes any sort of 
interaction with SCP-5070, are allowed. 

The only way of any sort of measurement or observation of SCP-5070 is through 
observation of the frequency and intensity of the constantly emitting 
electromagnetic pulses coming from SCP-5070. If SCP-5070 emits electromagnetic 
pulses at a wavelength under 10^-6 metres then procedure 1449-Lennar will 
commence. 

Description: SCP-5070 is a dark crimson coloured, vaguely seashell shaped 
entity, of unknown origin. It is approximately 5 metres tall, 0.5 metres wide on 
its lowest end and 4 metres wide on its top end. 

At SCP-5070’s top, acting like a mouth, is a vaguely circular, 2.6 metres wide 
hole. However, the hole does not have a visible bottom, and it looks like it is 
deeper than SCP-5070 is tall. SCP-5070 is constantly floating 0.5 metres above 
the ground, however no energy that could possibly cause this floating has been 
found. SCP-5070 is constantly emitting an electromagnetic pulse, usually at a 
wavelength of 10^4 metres. 

The wavelength seems to indicate a sort of slumber, as upon change to a shorter 
wavelength, SCP-5070 seems to become more active, sometimes resulting in [DATA 
EXPUNGED]. 

These wavelength changes seem to be caused sometimes randomly, but can also be 
caused by general interaction with SCP-5070 

A decrease of wavelength is to be prevented at all costs. Altough the properties 
of SCP-5070 are incredibly varying, and any experimentation trying to figure out 
its other properties are prohibited, it is generally agreed upon that SCP-5070 
can [DATA EXPUNGED] 


Addendum 5070-B: Extreme activity by SCP-5070: 

1: First Occurence, a minor earthquake causes an extreme change in wavelength, 
then SCP-5070 [DATA EXPUNGED]. Multiple staff members ████ in a pile of 
flesh, appearing to be combined with genetically ████ ██████ 

2: Second Occurence, a rogue staff member sets off explosives that, while it 
doesn't destroy the steel wall, causes the wavelengths to drastically decrease 
and SCP-5070 to dissepear following an explosion that destroys most of 
Site-██. After that, multiple pieces of Site-██ are found to be in 
different positions then they were before, and completely new additions to 
Site-██ are also found, similiar to the general infrastructure, but it 
wasn't there before. 

What follows is that SCP-5070 returns to the exact same position as before, and 
pieces of flesh and bodies whose genetics are both completely unknown and 
completely identical to already existing members of the foundation are found, 
even though some of them never recieved any wounds. 

It is believed that what happened was that SCP-5070 [DATA EXPUNGED]. No members 
of the foundation except for the 05 Council are allowed to know of the exact 
events at Site-██. Any surviving staff members were wiped of their memory, 
and the [DATA EXPUNGED] that was discovered were interrogated and then [DATA 
EXPUNGED]. 

3: Third Occurence, SCP-5070 spontaniously [DATA EXPUNGED]. 40560 civilians 
[DATA EXPUNGED]. [DATA EXPUNGED], causing a panic, following the failure of 
procedure 1449-Lennar, causing the death of [DATA EXPUNGED] and [DATA EXPUNGED].
