                                ----------------                                

Item #: SCP-1201 

Object Class: Euclid 

Special Containment Procedures: A 50 m perimeter around area 1201 is to be 
maintained at all times. Testing into the nature of SCP-1201-2 is to be done 
promptly and without hindrance to the route of SCP-1201-2 to prevent a possible 
containment breach of SCP-1201-3. 

Any change in behavior by SCP-1201-2 is to be immediately reported to the Site 
Director and the area is to be put on lock down. 

Changes in containment procedures are currently being drafted as of the incident 
outlined in Document 1201-C. 

Description: SCP-1201 is a shallow wall-fountain located in Damascus, Syria. The 
fountain itself displays no anomalous properties save for its use by SCP-1201-2. 
Although SCP-1201-2 appears to enter SCP-1201 during separate manifestations, 
entrance by Foundation personnel does not seem to be possible. An investigation 
is currently underway to confirm whether or not the placement of the well is 
purely coincidental. 

SCP-1201-2 appears to be a large, completely hairless chimpanzee similar in size 
to an average adult human male. Strength and agility exhibited by SCP-1201-2 is 
not considered to be abnormal relative to its size. 

The entity materializes within 40-48 meters of SCP-1201 each year on 
██/██ at 23:23:46 with severe injuries including third degree burns, 
severed limbs, deformities consistent with exposure to triflic acid, and holes 
scattered around the body. SCP-1201-2 regenerates in the space of 12.3 seconds 
before attempting to return to SCP-1201. An outline of a typical occurrence can 
be found in Document 1201-A. 

Attempts to halt the progress of SCP-1201-2 toward SCP-1201 have been 
effectively unsuccessful, as the entity appears to assault researchers when 
coerced, and prolonged confinement of the entity seems to produce an adverse 
effect originating near SCP-1201. SCP-1201-2 is not hostile toward researchers 
during its manifestations but will actively attempt to remove or disable 
barriers between it and SCP-1201. SCP-1201-2 appears to be highly vulnerable to 
electrical shock but further attempts to halt the progress of SCP-1201 are not 
recommended due to events outlined in Document-1201-B. 


Document 1201-A: Events of ██/██/2002, Area 1201 

Foreword: Fifth recorded incidence and observation of the manifestation of 
SCP-1201-2. The entity was questioned alongside researchers keeping pace with 
the movement of the entity on a pre-constructed motion track. The entity was 
visible for 20 seconds before disappearing into SCP-1201. 

SCP-1201-2 manifests 47 meters from SCP-1201. Subject appears heavily bruised 
around the torso and face, with third degree burns covering the body. SCP-1201-2 
appears to regenerate to typical appearance in the space of 12.3 seconds before 
righting itself and sprinting toward SCP-1201. Agent Breen attempts 
communication. 

SCP-1201-2: The hell do you guys want? 

Agent Breen: What are you doing? 

SCP-1201-2: Going to meet Beth. 

Agent Breen: Who is Beth? 

SCP-1201-2: A real bitch. 

Agent Breen: What is Beth? 

SCP-1201-2: A bitch. 

Agent Breen: Thank you for your cooperation. 

SCP-1201-2 disappears into SCP-1201.

Document 1201-B: Events of ██/██/1999, Area 1201 

Foreword: Second recorded incidence and observation of the manifestation of 
SCP-1201-2. The entity was temporarily disabled with a prefabricated electric 
field after regenerating. The entity was incapacitated for 18 seconds before 
power to the grid was removed by Agent Sanders and SCP-1201-2 was released. 

Agent Sanders: You're going to want to cooperate with us. 

SCP-1201-2: The fuck is your problem? 

SCP-1201-2 attempts to break from the electrical current but is not successful. 

Agent Sanders: We're going to need some information before you go anywhere. 

SCP-1201-2: Not telling you shit. 

SCP-1201 begins shaking, and partially fractures from its foundation. A long, 
smooth, black mass with the appearance of a tongue, which will henceforth be 
referred to as SCP-1201-3, can be seen partially probing from SCP-1201. The 
tongue stretches in length over 40 meters toward Agent Sanders. 

Agent Sanders terminates the power to the containment on SCP-1201-2. SCP-1201-2 
rights itself and collides with the appendage of SCP-1201-3, making contact and 
crashing into a wall. 

Flames begin to funnel out from the mouth of SCP-1201 and SCP-1201-2 is severely 
burned. SCP-1201-2 is pulled into the air by SCP-1201-3. 

SCP-1201-2: You bitch! 

SCP-1201-2 has the tip of the appendage in a headlock, 20 meters above ground. 
SCP-1201-2 begins tearing into the skin of the appendage with its teeth. 

SCP-1201-3 falls to the ground with SCP-1201-2. 

Flames begin to increase in volume from the mouth of SCP-1201. Temperature in 
the immediate area increases by 20 degrees Celsius. 

SCP-1201-2, still in possession of the end of SCP-1201-3, dives into the mouth 
of SCP-1201.

Document 1201-C: Events of ██/██/2003, Area 1201 

Foreword: Sixth recorded incidence and observation of the manifestation of 
SCP-1201-2. The entity was questioned alongside researchers keeping pace with 
the movement of the entity on a pre-constructed motion track. The entity was 
visible for 21 seconds before disappearing into SCP-1201. 

SCP-1201-2 manifests 49 meters from SCP-1201. Subject appears with a large hole 
in its torso. SCP-1201-2 appears to regenerate to typical appearance in the 
space of 12.3 seconds before righting itself and sprinting toward SCP-1201. 
Agent Breen attempts communication. 

SCP-1201-2: You guys are persistent. 

Agent Breen: Please tell us what you're doing. 

SCP-1201-2: Fine, fine. Since you're so fucking adamant about it. This has been 
going on for quite some time. Beth just doesn't know when to give up. I'm trying 
to teach it who the real king of Candy Land is. 

Agent Breen: You're being facetious? 

SCP-1201 jumps into the air, maintaining momentum while delivering a kick to 
Agent Breen's head. Agent Breen's head is severed and explodes on impact with a 
nearby wall. 

SCP-1201-2: You're ruining the fun. 

SCP-1201-2 disappears into SCP-1201.

Events of ██/██/20██, Area 1201

Foreword: █████ recorded incidence and observation of the
manifestation of SCP-1201-2. The entity was questioned alongside
researchers keeping pace with the movement of the entity on a
pre-constructed motion track. The entity was visible for 15 seconds
before disappearing with Agent Sanders into SCP-1201.

SCP-1201-2 manifests 40 meters from SCP-1201. Subject appears covered
in a viscous pink fluid, with mild burns covering the body. SCP-1201-2
appears to regenerate to typical appearance in the space of 12.3
seconds before righting itself and sprinting toward SCP-1201. Agent
Sanders attempts communication.

SCP-1201-2: You again, there, boss! HOWDY FUCKING DO?

Agent Sanders: Your compliance with testing protocol would be greatly
appreciated.

SCP-1201-2: Sure about that? Sure you ain't gonna fuck everything up?

Agent Sanders: …yes.

SCP-1201: You better not be a fucking noob.

SCP-1201-2 grabs Agent Sanders by the right leg and disappears into
SCP-1201.

Document 1201-█: Personal Notes

There was no sign of any place where we could have arrived, no
entrance, no device for travel. I checked my pulse, felt along my
skin: slightly elevated heartbeat, and I was mildly warm. I would have
to say that at that time I was also fairly distressed, so I apologize
for any inaccuracies in advance.

After the entity released my leg and dropped me I found myself on the
surface of a very small, empty, rocky planet. The sun was at least
three times as large in the sky, if it was the sun we know of. I would
not be surprised if it was Mercury, although this thought was briefly
quelled as I could see what appeared to be a large, flaming serpent
making loops in the distance on the sun's surface.

Strangely enough I did not have trouble breathing or staring directly
into the sun, and I was not at all affected by the intense heat. When
questioned, 1201-2 responded with "It's just fucking atmosphere." When
questioned if this was the place it always returned to when SCP-1201-2
entered the well, it responded "That would be lame as fuck."

1201-2 appeared to be running in place for a few brief moments before
the next event happened. I found that I could not advance either. When
questioned I was told that "It's fucking countdown." So, I remained
walking in place as 1201-2 was doing.

I fell forward on my face after hearing a large crystalline chime, and
1201-2 began laughing and issued a slur of insults before disappearing
far ahead of me. When I got my footing, I found that moving was rather
effortless, and I was running at about three times as fast as I
normally can. The experience was quite exhilarating if you don't mind
me saying.

I asked it where we were going. It told me that "We gotta find Beth
and kill that bitch." Like you, I wasn't entirely sure who Beth was or
why 1201-2 wanted to kill it, so I just continued running alongside
1201-2. In time I could see an enormous black mass of tentacles
floating in the distance. I asked 1201-2 what it was and it told me it
was "Fucking cheap as shit." When I asked to clarify the specific
nature of the entity, 1201-2 told me "It's just fucking overpowered."

So, being a bit hesitant, I slowed down a bit and let 1201-2 take the
lead. When we got a bit closer, it spoke. I'm not sure I can recall
its exact words, but it kept referring to 1201-2 as its "bitch" and
that "he sucked so bad". 1201-2 was visibly upset, and told it that it
"should make the first move". That's when the entity, which I'm
assuming to be 1201-3, advanced on 1201-2 and began whipping its
tentacles wildly at it. The motions themselves were peculiar in the
sense that each separate attack by 1201-2, and 1201-3 did not differ
in motion in the least bit, and was accompanied by a matching "cry".
I'm fairly certain I saw 1201-2 instantly right itself about four
times after being struck by the tentacles.

Yeah, right… after that it… 1201-2 told me "I'm getting low, fucking
help me you fucking noob." Which I have to say was completely
nonsensical because he had just allowed the thing to attack him in the
first pla- I'm sorry I'm getting off track here.

1201-2 retreated, froze in place, and begun glowing in a green light.
I was forced to attack the entity myself or run from it as its
attention was now turned to me. I was caught off guard momentarily by
a blinding light emanating from 1201-3's center, and unable to move
for one reason or another. 1201-2 told me that "If I wasn't a fucking
noob, I could 'glitch' stuns". I'm not entirely sure what he was
referring to, but after one or two seconds I could move again. That's
when one of its tentacles pierced through me… I saw an explosion of
gore from my chest, but I felt absolutely no pain whatsoever, and the
gore itself disappeared into the air. After seeing this I was a bit
more motivated to approach 1201-3 and speak to it as I was sure it
could not harm me.

I continued running toward the creature, trying to ignore the circling
clouds of tentacles and gore around my body. I asked it what it was,
but there was no response. It seemed rather focused on attacking me.
After a short time I started moving more slowly and I could hear a
loud, heartbeat sound in my head.

I could see 1201-2 circling in on it from behind out of the corner of
my eye. The heartbeat noise in my head was deafeningly loud at that
point, and I could barely move, and that's when I heard 1201-2's voice
yell "You lost, bitch!", followed by 1201-3 exploding.

A voice, the location it was produced from I cannot specify, asked
1201-2 "How it got a fucking NPC in a deathmatch." before I reappeared
at area 1201.
